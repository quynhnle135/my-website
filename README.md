# Personal Online Coding Journal Website

A personal coding journal crafted with [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/), showcasing my growth as a developer. Tailored the site's look and feel with custom JavaScript and CSS modifications. Journal entries, written in Markdown, chronicle my learning experiences and programming insights.
