# Coding Journal: Oct 22, 2023

### What I did today
- Finished all exercises in Sliding Window category in Leetcode 75:
    - Maximum Average Subarray I
    - Maximum Number of Vowels in a Substring of Given Length
    - Max Consecutive Ones III
    - Longest Subarray of 1's After Deleting One Element
- Reviewed and tried to finished my To Do List Django project (my goal is to finish deploying it by the end of next week and link it to my resume)
- Coding Interview practice Joceline


#### Notes from Coding Interview Practice Joceline 
- She's very new to this coding interview practice so it takes her 50 minutes to solve an easy problem (Squares of sorted array)
- She needs to pay more attention to global and local variables, and Javascript syntax. Her code still has a lot of bugs
- Instead jumpring right into coding, she should've discussed her approach to solve the given problem
- For my turn, she asked me to 2 easy Array question:
    - Find the Duplicate Number: I solve this using dictionary which helped me have the time complexity O(n) and space complexity O(n). However, she also mentioned that I can solve this problem by using marking negative to reach O(1) for space complexity
    - Missing number: I solved this problem also using a dictionary. I find my solution not too effective since I use three for loops (not nested) to and having another array. Will work on the more optimal solution for this
- I solved these two problems pretty quick, it only took me 20 minutes to finish my turn but it think it's because I've seen these problems before
- What I can learn from Joceline:
    - Maybe I should apply for apprenticeship to boost up my resume? 
    - I should've finsihed my projects and have my resume ready and send it out. 
    - Somehow I find myself a little bit more confident after today's session and have more motivation to speed up my process. It's good to have a girl peer in the same field and situation like me. 
- Our practice shedule: 5:00PM-6:30PM every Monday, Wednesday, and Thursday

#### My code for Find the Duplicate Number

```python 
def findDuplicated(nums):
  num_dict = {}
  for num in nums:
    if num in num_dict:
      return num
    else:
      num_dict[num] = 1
  return -1


print(findDuplicated([2, 1, 5, 2, 3, 3, 4]))  # 2
print(findDuplicated([2, 1, 5, 3, 3, 2, 4]))  # 3
print(findDuplicated([1, 2, 3, 4]))



# Given an array of integers between 1 and n, inclusive where n is the length of the array. Write a function that returns the first integer that appears more than once (when array if read from left to right)

# example: [1, 2, 3, 3]
# 3

#example 2: [2,1,5,2,3,3,4]
#            ^ ^
#2

#ex: [2,1,5,3,3,2,4]
# 3

# second approach: no need to use another data structure
# use nested loop
# for i = 0 -> nums.length
#    for j = i + 1
#       compare: if nums[i] == nums[j]: return nums[i]
# return -1

# Time complexity: O(n^2)
# Space complexity: O(1)

# first approach
# dictionary {value: appearance}
# traverse thru the array
# if the cur value not in the dict: dict[value] = 1
# else: return value
# finish for loop, return -1
# time complexity: O (n)
# space: O(n)

# notes
# if no duplicated found -> return -1

```

#### My code for Missing Numbers problem

``` python
# Youre given an unordered list of unique integers nums in the range [1,n], where n represents the length of nums +2. this means that two numbers in this range are missing from the list. Write a function that takes in this list and returns a new list with the two missing numbers, sorted numerically .

# notes:
# not sorted list
# return the sorted of missing numbers
# no duplicated

# nums = [1,4,3] -> [1, 3, 4]
#[2,5] n is 5  -> [1,2,3,4,5]

# nums = [1, 2]
# [3, 4] n = 4 -> [1, 2, 3, 4]

# first approach
# sort the given nums nums = [1, 3, 4]
#                             ^
# n = len(nums) + 2 = 5
# dict = {1: 1, 2: 1, 3: 1, 4: 1, 5: 1}
# traverse value in the given nums:
#    check if current value is in dictionary:
#             dict[value] -= 1
# res = []
# go over the dictionary
# if dict[value] != 0:
#     res.append(value)
# return res

# time: O(n)
# space: O(n)


def findMissingNumbers(nums):
  res = []
  num_dict = {}
  n = len(nums) + 2
  for i in range(n):
    value = i + 1
    num_dict[value] = 1
  for num in nums:
    if num in num_dict:
      num_dict[num] -= 1
  for key in num_dict:
    if num_dict[key] != 0:
      res.append(key)
  return res


print(findMissingNumbers([1, 4, 3]))  # 2, 5
print(findMissingNumbers([1, 2]))  # 3, 4

```
