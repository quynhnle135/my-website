### What I did today
- Update README file for Expense Management OOP project + review the whole project to see what I did there since it's been a while. You can view the project here: https://github.com/quynhnle135/expense-management-oop
- Tried to update README for Expense Managment API project but there's something wrong since I cannot run the server. Reviewed and worked on that. 
- Leetcode 75: Continue with Stack problems
