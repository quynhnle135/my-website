# Coding Journal: Dec 01, 2023

# 1. What I Learned and Did Today
- Installed Daily.dev as my default browser.
- Bought domain quinnle.io and updated my website to this new domain.
- Read and summarized ["How to use Marketing Techniques to Build A Better Resume"](https://quinnle.io/docs/tech-blogs/notes/post_1)
- Created section [Reseaseach Topics](https://quinnle.io/docs/category/research-topics), inside this section will have [Communication](https://quinnle.io/docs/research-topics/communications/first_communication_post) as sub-section.
- Created section [Troubleshooting](https://quinnle.io/docs/category/troubleshooting) to take notes when I had to solve my problems and coding or making projects.
- Added Infoq, Mostly Python, and The Engineering Manager in [Techblogs Archive](https://quinnle.io/docs/tech-blogs/archive)(last three sentences).
- [Static Site Generators research](https://quinnle.io/docs/research-topics/static_site_generator)
- Wrote [Custom Domain post](https://quinnle.io/docs/troubleshooting/custom_domain) in Troubleshooting to take notes how I updated my website to the new domain.

# 2. Questions I Have
- How can I make my app only return the data of current logged-in user? Because it's showing all data that all accounts have been adding to the database.
- How can I create a search function in my app?
- What's the difference between get_querryset and get_context_data in Django?

# 3. What I Found Challenging
- Added login, logout, and register functionalities to the project. I have to make sure that user cannot view expense or update them without logging in first.
- There are several ways to write UserRegister views and I got really confused at first.
- There are many different ways to build an API using Django REST Framework. I use generic API views and the framework mostly handles everything for me, which is very magical but confusing to me as well. 
- Planned to expand my Expense Manager project: calculate and display the total amount in the head, add search function which will return expense records based on card, category, note, date, amount, etc.
- Updated CSS

# 4. Code I Wrote Today
Set up model
```python title="expense_manager_app/models.py"
from django.db import models
from django.contrib.auth.models import User
from django.utils import timezone


# Create your models here.
class Expense(models.Model):
    user = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    card = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    category = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    expense_date = models.DateField(default=timezone.now)
    amount = models.DecimalField(max_digits=5, decimal_places=2)
    notes = models.TextField(null=True, blank=True)

    def __str__(self):
        return f"{self.card} -  {self.expense_date} - {self.amount}"
```

```python title="expense_manager_app/views.py"
from django.contrib.auth import login
from django.views import generic
from .models import Expense
from django.urls import reverse_lazy
from django.contrib.auth.mixins import LoginRequiredMixin
from django.contrib.auth.views import FormView
from . import forms
from django.db.models import Q
from django.db.models import Sum


class UserRegisterView(FormView):
    form_class = forms.RegisterForm
    template_name = "expense_manager_app/register.html"
    redirect_authenticated_user = True
    success_url = reverse_lazy("login")

    def form_valid(self, form):
        user = form.save()
        if user is not None:
            login(self.request, user)
        return super().form_valid(form)


class ExpenseListView(LoginRequiredMixin, generic.ListView):
    login_url = "/login/"
    model = Expense
    context_object_name = "expenses"
    template_name = "expense_manager_app/expense_list.html"


class ExpenseSearchView(LoginRequiredMixin, generic.ListView):
    login_url = "/login/"
    model = Expense
    template_name = "expense_manager_app/expense_search_list.html"
    context_object_name = "expenses"


class ExpenseDetailView(LoginRequiredMixin, generic.DetailView):
    login_url = "/login/"
    model = Expense
    context_object_name = "expense"
    template_name = "expense_manager_app/expense_detail.html"


class ExpenseCreateView(LoginRequiredMixin, generic.CreateView):
    login_url = "/login/"
    model = Expense
    fields = ["card", "category", "expense_date", "amount", "notes"]
    template_name = "expense_manager_app/expense_form.html"
    success_url = reverse_lazy("expense-list")

    def form_valid(self, form):
        form.instance.user = self.request.user
        form.save()
        return super().form_valid(form)


class ExpenseUpdateView(LoginRequiredMixin, generic.UpdateView):
    login_url = "/login/"
    model = Expense
    fields = ["card", "category", "expense_date", "amount", "notes"]
    template_name = "expense_manager_app/expense_update_form.html"
    success_url = reverse_lazy("expense-list")


class ExpenseDeleteView(LoginRequiredMixin, generic.DeleteView):
    login_url = "/login/"
    model = Expense
    template_name = "expense_manager_app/expense_confirm_delete.html"
    success_url = reverse_lazy("expense-list")

```

```python title="expense_manager_app/urls.py"
from django.urls import path
from . import views
from django.contrib.auth import views as auth_views

urlpatterns = [
    # User login/logout/register functions
    path("register/", views.UserRegisterView.as_view(), name="register"),
    path("login/", auth_views.LoginView.as_view(template_name="expense_manager_app/login.html", next_page="expense-list"), name="login"),
    path("logout/", auth_views.LogoutView.as_view(next_page="login"), name="logout"),
    # Expense CRUD functions
    path("", views.ExpenseListView.as_view(), name="expense-list"),
    path("<int:pk>/", views.ExpenseDetailView.as_view(), name="expense-detail"),
    path("add/", views.ExpenseCreateView.as_view(), name="expense-add"),
    path("update/<int:pk>/", views.ExpenseUpdateView.as_view(), name="expense-update"),
    path("delete/<int:pk>/", views.ExpenseDeleteView.as_view(), name="expense-delete")
]
```

I also created templates for each views, which you can view them [here](https://github.com/quynhnle135/expense-manager/tree/main/expense_manager_app/templates/expense_manager_app)
