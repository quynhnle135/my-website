# 1. What I Learned and Did Today
- Continued with my News Generator project. Here's what my plan I got for my project so far:
    * Make a CLI tool that users can interact with news API by providing category, keywords, date, language, and date, etc.
    * Task schedule with Cron to add 10-20 articles to my website in Tech Blogs section
        * Create templates to represent these articles the tool returns

# 2. Questions I Have
- What are the differences between <b>everything, top-headlines, and sources endpoints in News API?</b>
    * Everything: ```https://newsapi.org/v2/everything```
        * The <i><b>everything</b></i> endpoint allows you to search through <b>a vast database of articles published by various news sources</b>
        * You can use it to find articles <b>matching a specific query</b>; <b>filter</b> articles by dates, languages, or <b>sort</b> them by relevance, popularity, or date of publications
        * This endpoint is <b>useful for conducting in-depth research on a specific topic</b> or tracking the coverage of a particular story overtime
    * Top-headlines: ```https://newsapi.org/v2/top-headlines```
        * The <i><b>top-headlines</b></i> endpoint provides the latest headlines from major news publishers
        * It allows you to <b>filter</b> headlines by country, category, or specific sources. You can also <b>search</b> for headlines containing specific keywords
        * <b><i>This endpoint is ideal for applications that require the latest new updates, such as news aggregators or dashboards that display the latest headlines in real time.</i></b>
    * Source: ```https://newsapi.org/v2/top-headlines/sources```
        * The <i><b>sources</b></i> endpoint gives information about the news sources available in the News API database
        * It allows you to filter sources by criteria such as country, language, and category
        * This endpoint is useful for understanding the range of sources available and for selecting specific sources to focus on when using the other endpoints
