- Read and summarized [6 skills required to be a senior software engineer](https://quinnle.io/docs/tech-blogs/level-up-software-engineering/post_9)

# 2. Questions I Have?
- What is linear data structure?
- What is non-linear data structure?
- What is hierarchical data structure?

### What is a linear data structure?
- Linear data structure is a type of data structure where the arrangement of the data follows a linear trend
- The data elements are arranged linearly such that the element is <b>directly linked to its previous and the next elements</b>
- If the size of the data structure increases, the time complexity of the data structure increases as well
- Some examples of linear data structure: <b>array, queue, stack, linked list</b>

### What is a non-linear data structure?
- Non-linear data structure is a type of data structure in which data elements are not arranged in a sequential order.
- In non-linear data structure, elements are connected to multiple elements, <b>forming a hierarchical or multi-level arrangement</b>
- Some examples of non-linear data structure: Trees and graphs

<b><i>Hash Tables can be implemented in linear manner, their behavior is non-linear. Because they store data in an associative manner, where each value is defined by a unique key</i></b>


# 3. What I Found Challenging?
- Trying to solve this small project where I can apply 5 concepts of creational design pattern: Factory method, Abstract Factory, Builder, Prototype, and Singleton

# 4. Code I Wrote Today

Applied Singleton when creating zoo management system because there should be only one management system the zoo

```python title="zoo_management_system.py"
class ZooManagementSystem:
    _instance = None

    def __new__(cls):
        if cls._instance is None:
            cls._instance = super(ZooManagementSystem, cls).__new__(cls)
        return cls._instance


```
Create Factory for animal

```python title="zoo.py"
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod


class Animal(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def make_sound(self):
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def drink(self):
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def eat(self):
        pass


class Lion(Animal):
    def make_sound(self):
        print("ROAR...")

    def drink(self):
        print("Lion is drinking water...")

    def eat(self):
        print("Lion is eating...")


class Elephant(Animal):
    def make_sound(self):
        print("Making elephant sound...")

    def drink(self):
        print("Elephant is drinking water...")

    def eat(self):
        print("Elephant is eating...")


class AnimalFactory():
    def create_animal(self):
        pass


class LionFactory(AnimalFactory):
    def create_animal(self):
        return Lion()


class ElephantFactory(AnimalFactory):
    def create_animal(self):
        return Elephant()



```

Start with Habitat builder but I haven't finished it yet, will continue with this small project first thing in the morning:

```python title="habitat_builder.py"
from zoo import Lion, Elephant


class Habitat:
    def description(self):
        pass


class Savannah(Habitat):
    def description(self):
        return "Savannah habitat..."


class Jungle(Habitat):
    def description(self):
        return "Jungle habitat..."


class HabitatFactory:
    def create_habitat(self):
        pass

    def create_animal(self):
        pass


class SavannahFactory(HabitatFactory):
    def create_habitat(self):
        return Savannah()

    def create_animal(self):
        return Lion()


class JungleFactory(HabitatFactory):
    def create_habitat(self):
        return Jungle()

    def create_animal(self):
        return Elephant()

```

## What I will do tomorrow:
- Finish the Zoo management project applying creation desing patterns
- Finish two posts which are still half-way done (data structures and skills required to be a senior swe)
- Read 3 more artcles in todolist
- Summarize the concepts of builder, prototype, and singleton
