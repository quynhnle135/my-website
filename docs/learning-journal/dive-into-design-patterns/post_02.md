# Dive Into Design Patterns: Introduction to Design Patterns

## What is a Design Pattern?

- Design patterns are typical solutions to commonly occuring problems in software design. They are like blueprints that you can customize to solve a recurring design problem in your code

## What does the pattern consist of?
Most patterns are described very formally so people can reproduce them in many contexts. Here are the sections that are usually present in a pattern description:
- Intent of the pattern briefly describes both the problem and the solution
- Motivation further explains the problem and the solution the pattern makes possible
- Structure of classes each part of the pattern and shwo they are related
- Code example in onbe of the popular programming language makes it easier to grasp the idea behind the pattern

## Classification of patterns.
- The most basic and low-level patterns are often called <b>idioms</b>. They usually apply only to a single programming language
- The most universal and high-level patterns are <b>architectural patterns</b>. Unlike other patterns, they can be used to design the architecture of an entire application
- Three main groups of patterns will be covered in this book:
    * Creational patterns: provide object creation mechanisms that increase flexibility and reuse of existing code
    * Structural patterns: explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping these structures flexible anbd efficient
    * Behavioral patterns: take care of effective communication and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.

## Why should I learn patterns?
- Design patterns are a toolkit of <b>tried and tested solutions</b> to common problems in software design
