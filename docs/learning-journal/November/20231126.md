# Coding Journal: Nov 26, 2023

# 1. What I Learned and Did Today
* Continued with my Automate Spotify Python project. Added all functions I need and set up task schedule to automatically add tracks to chosen playlist, which will happen every hour and every Monday. So I have to wait till tomorrow to know if it works or not. 

* I did test and try corntab before applying to the project. 
    
* Learned about cron and crontab to schedule tasks.

# 2. Questions I Have

* What are cron and crontabs?
    
    * Cron is the system's main schedule for running jobs or task unattended.
        
    * A command called crontab allows the user to submit, edit, or delete entries to cron.


# 3. What I Found Challenging

* Assign arguments for the parser.add\_argument()
    
* I get confused about some attributes such as nargs, default, action="store\_true", const, etc:
    - nargs is the number of arguments needed, it can be "?" (a single value which can be optional), "+" (1 or many), or "*" (zero or many)
    
* The order of the command lines and given functions. For example when I run the command "-d" to view tracks from current Day List playlist, it shows the saved tracks first then the tracks from the current Day List, which means the view\_saved\_tracks() functions has been called and runs before the view\_daylist\_tracks() although I just want to see the Day List Playlist's track
    
    \=&gt; Have to take a look at the give arguments in both functions.

* Using crontab. There are two commands that I used the most which are "crontab -l" to list out current active crontab and "crontab -e" to edit or create new crontab to schedule task. However, the problem lies in the permission to access a file and to excute the script or a program. Therefore, before creating any task schedule with crontab, I need to give the permission to read and excute to the specified file (chmod a+x filename)

* Couldn't run a Python module directly from crontab so I have to write scripts and make the crontab run them instead. Script is a sequence of instruction that is interpreted or carried out by another program rather than by the computer processor. I wrote daylist.sh script anbd weekly.sh script with the commandlines to run the specific functions I wanted.

# 4. Code I Wrote Today
