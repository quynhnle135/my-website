#### Cousera Notes:
- Go over time and space complexity
- Go over basic and advanced data structures: string, list, set, dictionary, linked list, hash table, tree, graphs

#### Interview with Brandon 7:30PM

First question: give a string of numbers (for ex: [1, 2, 3]), return the most frequent number in that string "123232111" -> 1

Clarifying question:
- can have empty string -> return -1
- only valid digit
- only positive number
- not sorted

examples
"123" -> return the maximum value -> 3

"11112233334" -> 3v

1st approach
- use dict to store the appeance while traverse
- update the value in the dict if i see again in the string
- return the key value with the max value
- if we have the same appearance (same value) -> return the max key

time complexity: O(n)
space: O(n) -> Wrong -> should be O(1)

``` python
def find_max_appearance(num_str):
  if num_str == "":
    return -1

  num_dict = {}
  # {1: 1, 2: 1, 3: 1}
  max_val = -1
  max_key = -1
  for n in num_str:
      num = int(n)
    if int(n) in num_dict:
      num_dict[int(n)] += 1
    else:
      num_dict[int(n)] = 1
      # if int(n) > max_key:
      #   max_key = int(n)

  for key in num_dict: # 3
    val = num_dict[key]  # current value: 1
    if val >= max_val: # 1 > 2
      if key > max_key: # 1 > - 1
        max_key = key # 1
        max_val = val # 2

  return max_key

def main():
  print(find_max_appearance("123"))  # 3
  print(find_max_appearance("11112233334"))  # 3

if __name__ == "__main__":
  main()

```


Second question: given two list that sorted , return that sorted list with all element of two given lists and sorted

Clarifying question: 
- may have empty list
- ascending sorted
- duplicated numbers may appear
- negative number may appear

1st approach
- if not list1 : -> return list2
- if not list2: -> return list1
- res = [0] * (len(list1) + len(list2)) -> no need -> res = []
- two pointer i, j
- while i < len(list1) and j < len(list2):
- compare list1[i] and list2[j]
- smaller -> append it to the res
- if list1[i] < list2[j]:
- res.append(list1[i])
- i += 1

- make sure there's no element left in both the array:
- while list1: -> append res
- while list2: -> append res

time complexity: O(n + m)
space complexity: O(n + m)

``` python
def merge_lists(list1, list2):
  if not list1:
    return list2
  if not list2:
    return list1

  res = []
  i = j = 0
  while (i < len(list1)) and (j < len(list2)):
    if list1[i] < list2[j]:
      res.append(list1[i])
      i += 1
    else:
      res.append(list2[j])
      j += 1

  while i < len(list1):
    res.append(list1[i])
    i += 1

  while j < len(list2):
    res.append(list2[j])
    j += 1

  return res


print(merge_lists([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]))
print(merge_lists([2, 4, 6, 7], [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8]))
print(merge_lists([1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8], [2, 4, 6, 7]))
print(merge_lists([], [1, 2, 3]))
print(merge_lists([1, 2, 3], []))
print(merge_lists([], []))
print(merge_lists(None, None))
```

#### Feedback 

Weakness:
- Don’t use variables -> Should assign variables to keep track and not over-repeating in your code
- Condition for the first problem -> Trip off because not giving the variables to keep track
- Try not to be panic -> Go over the code to make sure about the time complexity and space complexity 
- If the problem changes -> Going back to the examples -> Working line by line to the code to work on the improved solution -> See if we can reproduce or get rid of some parts 

Suggestions: 
What do you suggest to become better at coding/techincal interview? 
- Leetcode, books (Cracking the coding interview)
- OOP, design system -> Review

If I don't have much working experiences, how can I do well in behavioral interview?
- Make some stuff up  -> They want to see how you work with group projects
Interviewer may ask like:
- Work on the project, somebody on the project tells you have the answer of the exam 
- Manager ask you to do something but it was clear 
- Time that missed deadline 
- Internship struggles 
-> Want to see how your mind works under the pressure 
-> May ask different kind of pressure you gotta work under, leadership,...

Do you have any tips or your own strategy when you're in a coding interview?
- Managing your time well
- When struggling, should step back and listen to what interviewer wants to guide -> Try to repeat what they’re saying
