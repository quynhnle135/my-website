# Coding Journal: Jan 02, 2024

# 1. What I Learned and Did Today
- Created a Google Sheet to keep track of applying process
- Updated resume
- Updated website (Learning Journals &rarr; Journals, Tech Blogs &rarr; Notes)
- Reviewed and solved some Binary Search problems:
    - Search a 2D Matrix
    - Search Insert Postion
    - Find Peak Element
- Had mock interview (I was the interviewee) 4:00pm &rarr; Were asked Number of Lakes questions with follow-up questions

# 2. Questions I Had
Here are some questions I had when browsing jobs:
- What exactly should I look for in job postings?
- What are the priorities? (Skill relevant, years of experience, compensation, location)
- What is SOLID software engineering principle?
- What is the difference between Domain-driven development vs. Test-drive development?
- What exactly is SaaS?
- What is ORM library?
- What is MERN stack?

# 3. What I Found Challenging
- I haven't found anything challenging today

# 4. Code I Wrote Today
- [Search in 2D Matrix](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-a-2d-matrix/)

```python
class Solution:
    def searchMatrix(self, matrix: List[List[int]], target: int) -> bool:
        row = 0
        col = len(matrix[0]) - 1
        while 0 <= row < len(matrix) and 0 <= col < len(matrix[0]):
            cur = matrix[row][col]
            if cur == target:
                return True
            elif cur < target:
                row += 1
            else:
                col -= 1
        return False
```

- [Search Insert Position](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-insert-position/)

```python
class Solution:
    def searchInsert(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        if target <= nums[0]:
            return 0
        if target > nums[-1]:
            return len(nums)
        
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[i] == target:
                return i
            elif (i < len(nums) - 1) and (nums[i] < target <= nums[i + 1]):
                return i + 1
            

```

- [Find Peak Element](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-peak-element/)

```python
class Solution:
    def findPeakElement(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        left = 0
        right = len(nums) - 1
        while left < right:
            mid = (right + left) // 2
            if nums[mid] > nums[mid + 1]:
                right = mid
            else:
                left = mid + 1
        return left
```
