# 4. Notes I Took Today

#### What is Azure Container Registry? 
- Azure Container Registry is a managed registry service based on the open-sourced Docker Registry 2.0
- Create and maintain Azure Container Registries to store and manage your container images and related artifacts

#### Azure Container Registry use cases: 
- Pull images from an Azure container registry to various deployment targets: 
    - <b>Scalable orchestration systems</b> that manage containerized applications across clusters of hosts, including Kubernetes, DC/OS, and Docker Swarm
    - <b>Azure services</b> that support building and running applications at scale, including Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), App Service, Batch, and Service Fabric
- Developers can also push to a container registry as part of a container development workflow
- Configure ACR Tasks to automatically rebuild application images when their base images are udpated, or automate image builds when your team commits code to a Git repository
- Create multi-step tasks to automate building, testing, and patching multiple container images in parallel in the cloud

#### Azure Container Registry service tiers:
- <b>Basic</b>: A cost-optimized entry points for developers learning about Azure Container Registry. Basic registries have the same programmatic capabilities as Standard and Premium. However, the included storage and iamge throughput are most appropriate for lower usage scenario
- <b>Standard</b>: Offer the same capabilities as Basic, with <i>increased included storage and image throughput</i>. Standard registries should satisfy the needs of most production scenarios
- <b>Premium</b>: <i>Provide the highest amount of included storage and concurrent operations, enabling high-volume scenarios</i>. In addition to higher image throughput, Premium adds features such as <b>geo-replication</b> for managing a single registry across multiple regions, <b>content trust</b> for image tag signing, and <b>private link</b> with private endpoints to restrict access to the registry

#### Explore storage capabilities
- All Azure Container Registry tiers benefit from advanced Azure storage features like encryption-at-rest for image data security and geo-redundancy for image data protection: 
    - <mark><b><i>Encryption-at-last</i></b></mark>: All container images and other artifacts in your registry are encrypted at rest. Azure automatically <b>encrypts an image before storing it</b>, and decrypts it on-the-fly when you or your application and services pull the image. 
    - <mark><b><i>Regional storage</i></b></mark>: Azure Container Registry <b>stores data in the region where the registry is created</b>, to help customers meet data residency and compliance requirements. In all regions except Brazil South and South East Asia, <b>Azure may also store registry data in a paired region in the same geography</b>. In Brazil South and South East Asia regions, registry data is always confined to the region, to accomodate data residency requirementsfor those regions. 
    - <mark><b><i>Geo-replication</i></b></mark>: For scenarios requiring high availability assurance, consider using the geo-replication feature of Premium registries. Geo-replication <b>helps guard against losing access to your registry in a regional failure event</b>. Geo-replication provides other benefits too, like network-close image storage for faster pushes and pulls-in distributed development or deployment scenarios
    - <mark><b><i>Zone redundancy</i></b></mark>: A feature of the Premium service tier, <b>zone redundancy uses Azure availability zones to replicate your registry to a minimum of three separate zones in each enabled region</b>. 
    - <mark><b><i>Scalable storage</i></b></mark>: Azure Container Registry allows you to create as many repositories, images, layers, or tags as you need up to the registry storage limit. 


#### Build and manage containers with tasks:
- Azure Container Registry (ACR) tasks are a suite of features that:
    - Provide cloud-based container image building for platforms like Linux, Windows, and Advanced RISC Machines (ARM)
    - Extend the early parts of an application development cycle to the cloud with on-demand container image builds
    - Enable automated builds triggered by source code updates, updates to a container's base image, or timers
- ACR Tasks support several scenarios to build and maintain container images and other artifacts:
    - Quick task: build and push a single container image to a container registry on-demand, in Azure, without needing a local docker Engine installation. Think ```docker build```, ```docker push``` in the cloud
    - Automatically triggered tasks: enable one or more triggers to build an image:
        - Trigger on source code update
        - Trigger on base image update
        - Trigger on a schedule
    - Multiple-step task: extend the single image build-and-push capability of ACR Tasks with multi-step, multi-container-based workflows

#### Explre elements of Dockerfile
- A Dockerfile is a script that contains a series of instructions that are used to build a Docker image. Dockerfiles typically include the following information: 
    - The base or parent image we use to create the new image
    - Commands to update the base OS and install other software
    - Build artifacts to include, such as a developed application
    - Services to expose, such a storage and network configuration
    - Command to run when the container is launched

#### Explore Azure Container Instances
- Azure Container Instances (ACI) is a great solution for any scenario that can operate in isolated containers, including simple applications, task automation, and build jobs. Here are some of the benefits:
    - <mark>Fast startup</mark>: ACI can start containers in Azure in seconds, without the need to provision and manage a virtual machine (VM).
    - <mark>Container access</mark>: ACI enables exposing your container groups directly to the internet with an IP address and a fully qualified domain name (FQDN).
    - <mark>Hypervisor-level security</mark>: Isolate your application as completely as it would be in a VM.
    - <mark>Customer data</mark>: The ACI service stores the minimum customer data required to ensure your container groups are running as expected.
    - <mark>Customer sizes</mark>: ACI provides optimum utilization by allowing exact specifications of CPU cores and memory.
    - <mark>Persistent storage</mark>: Mount Azure Files shares directly to a container to retrieve and persist state.
    - <mark>Linux and Windows</mark>: Schedule both Windows and Linux containers using the same API.
