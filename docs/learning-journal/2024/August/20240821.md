# Coding Journal: Aug 21, 2024

# 1. What I Learned and Did Today
- Started studying for AZ204 - Azure Developer Associate
- Completed AZ-204: Implement Azure App Service Web App:
    - Explore Azure App Service
    - Configure web app settings
    - Scale apps in Azure App Service
    - Explore Azure App Service deployment slots

# 2. Questions I Had Today
- What is SDK? &rarr; Software Development Kit
- Authentication vs Authorization? &rarr; Authentication verifies user's identification; Authorization determines user's access rights and grant access on that level.
- Inbound vs outbound of network traffic? &rarr; Inbound traffic is the data coming into your Azure cloud/resource from the internet or other networks; Outbound traffic is the data leaving your Azure cloud/resource to other network.
- Platform bitness?
- What is scalability? Scale in/out vs up/down? 
    - Scalability in cloud computing is the ability to adjust the size/power of an IT solution or resource quickly and easily to meet changing demands.
    - Vertical scaling - scale up: Increase the capacity of a single instance (server) by adding more computing and processing power to a maching &rarr; Allow you to maintain resources while increasing the machine's performance
    - Horizontal scaling: Distribute the workload across multiple machines by adding more instances &rarr; Satisfy changing amouts of requests
    - Auto-scaling: A cloud computing feature that automatically adjust the allocation of resources based on demand.
- What is container in cloud computing? &rarr; Containers are packages of software that contain all of the necessary elements to run in any environment
- What is continous integration/deployment?
    - Continous integration (CI): refers to the practice of automatically and frequently integrating code changes into a shared source code repository.
    - Continous delivery/deployment (CD): 2 part process that referes to the intefration, testing, and deliver of code changes &rarr; Continuous deployment means that a developer's change to a cloud application could go live within minutes of writing it.

# 3. What I Found Challenging Today
- What I found challenging today is how to stay focus to study as much and effectively as possible.

# 4. Code I Wrote Today
I didn't write any code today but here are some important notes in the modules I studied today.
- What is Azure App Service? 
    - Azure App Service is an HTTP-based service for web applications, APIs, and mobile backends. 
    - Azure App Service features:  
        - Built-in auto scale support
        - Container support
        - Continuous integration/deployment support
        - Deployment slots
