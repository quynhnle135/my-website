### Educative: Data Structures for Coding Interview Java
Graph review:

- Graph implementation

- Breadth First Search: Use Queue

- Depth First Search: Use Stack

Tree:

- Tree Implementation

- Tree Insertation/Add: Have two ways which are iterative and recursive

- Tree Deletation: There are three cases that you should pay attention to:

    - Leaf node which has no child
    - Leaf node which has one child
    - Leaf node whic has two child (find the least node)
- Tree Traverse: Pre-order (NLR), In-order (LNR), Post-order (LRN)

* Note: Binary Search Tree is different from Binary Tree because in Binary Search Tree, nodes are organized according to value. Smaller value will be on the left while the larger one will be on the right.
