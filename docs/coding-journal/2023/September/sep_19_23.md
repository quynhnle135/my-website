## Go over Recursion (To prepare for Tree and Graph)


##### Facotiral

``` python
def find_factorial(n):
    # Base case
    if n <= 1:
        return 1
    return n * find_factorial(n - 1)


def main():
    print(find_factorial(5))  # 5! = 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 x 5 = 120
    print(find_factorial(3))  # 3! = 1 x 2 x 3 = 6
    print(find_factorial(10))  # 10! = 3628800


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

##### Fibonacci

``` python
def find_fibonacci(n):
    if n == 1 or n == 2:
        return 1
    return find_fibonacci(n - 1) + find_fibonacci(n - 2)


def main():
    print(find_fibonacci(n=5))  # 5 = 1, 1, 2, 3, 5
    print(find_fibonacci(n=8))  # 8 = 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

```

##### Greatest common factor

``` python
def find_gcd(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        return a
    return find_gcd(b, a % b)


def find_gcd_iterative(a, b):
    while b != 0:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a


def greatest_common_factor_iterative(a, b):
    a_factors =[]
    b_factors = []
    # Find all factors of a
    for i in range(1, a + 1):
        if a % i == 0:
            a_factors.append(i)
    # Find all factors of b
    for i in range(1, b + 1):
        if b % i == 0:
            b_factors.append(i)

    greatest_factor = float("-inf")
    for f in a_factors:
        # Find the common factor
        if f in b_factors:
            # Check if the common factor is greatest
            if f > greatest_factor:
                greatest_factor = f
    return greatest_factor


def main():
    print(greatest_common_factor_iterative(56, 48))
    print(find_gcd(56, 48))
    print(find_gcd_iterative(56, 48))


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

##### Palindrome

``` python
def check_palindrome(s):
    return check_palindrome_helper(s, 0, len(s) - 1)


def check_palindrome_helper(s, left, right):
    # Base case
    if left >= right:
        return True

    if s[left] != s[right]:
        return False

    return check_palindrome_helper(s, left + 1, right - 1)


def main():
    print(check_palindrome("hannah"))
    print(check_palindrome("meta"))
    print(check_palindrome("abba"))


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

```

##### Power of number

``` python
def find_power_of_number(x, n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    if n == 1:
        return x
    return x * find_power_of_number(x, n - 1)


def main():
    print(find_power_of_number(2, 3))
    print(find_power_of_number(5, 2))
    print(find_power_of_number(10, 0))


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

##### Reverse a string

```python
def reverse_a_string(s):
    if len(s) <= 1:
        return s
    return s[-1] + reverse_a_string(s[:-1])


def main():
    print(reverse_a_string("hello"))
    print(reverse_a_string("python"))
    print(reverse_a_string("leetcode"))


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

##### Sum of array

``` python
def find_sum_of_array(arr):
    if not arr:
        return 0
    return arr[0] + find_sum_of_array(arr[1:])


def main():
    print(find_sum_of_array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))  # 15
    print(find_sum_of_array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]))  # 55


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Notes for recursion review:
- I find myself really weak at recursion so that's why I have hard time understanding trees, graphs, DFS, and BFS.
- When it comes to recursion, try to set the base case and sub problem that will be solved recursively
- Recursion doesn't need to solve everything in one function, you can creat a helper function and solve it recursively in that function.


## Interviewing.io (me being the interviewee)

### Pairs of songs with total durations divisible by 60

``` python
class Solution(object):
    def numPairsDivisibleBy60(self, time):
        """
        :type time: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        if len(time) <= 1:
            return 0

        remainder_dict = {}
        count = 0
        for i in range(len(time)):
            remainder = time[i] % 60

            if remainder not in remainder_dict:
                remainder_dict[remainder] = 0

            if remainder == 0:
                if remainder in remainder_dict:
                    count += remainder_dict[remainder]

            if (60 - remainder) in remainder_dict:
                count += remainder_dict[60 - remainder]

            remainder_dict[remainder] += 1

        return count
```

### notes for today's practice interview session:
- I boomed this interview because I couldn't improve my solution based on interviewer's hints
- When getting hints, I should have thought more about it and tried to solve it on my own rather than rely on the interviewer
- Feedback: Communication is fine, speaking out loud when trying to solve the problem but need to improve technical and problem solving skills. Keeep leetcoding. 


## Leetcode Daily Challenge: Minimum Operations to reduce X to Zero

``` python
class Solution(object):
    def minOperations(self, nums, x):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :type x: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        n = len(nums)
        total = sum(nums)
        target = total - x
        if target == 0:
            return n
        start = 0
        cur_sum = 0
        longest_sub_len = -1
        for end in range(n):
            cur_sum += nums[end]
            while (cur_sum > target) and (start <= end):
                cur_sum -= nums[start]
                start += 1
            if cur_sum == target:
                longest_sub_len = max(longest_sub_len, end - start + 1)
                cur_sum -= nums[start]
                start += 1
        if longest_sub_len != -1:
            return n - longest_sub_len
        return -1
```

### Notes for this challenge:
- It may be difficult at first but if you think differently, you can easily solve it
- I tried to find the minimum elements of both end of the array but you can find the longest sub array instead
- Finding the longest sub array can be solved easily with sliding window approach 
- When solving the problem, it's not necessary to solve it literally how it's described. Look at the problem differently or the surroundings of the target or the complement can be the solution
