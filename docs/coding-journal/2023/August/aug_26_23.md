## Doing some exercises about Django REST API

### Learn about Serializer in Django REST API

#### BookList project

``` python title="booklist/settings.py"
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'django.contrib.admin',
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'django.contrib.messages',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',
    'BooklistAPI',
    'rest_framework',
]
```


``` python title="booklist/urls.py"
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path, include

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('api/', include('BooklistAPI.urls')),
]
```

#### BookListAPI app


``` python title="booklistapi/models.py"
from django.db import models

# Create your models here.


class Book(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    author = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    price = models.DecimalField(max_digits=5, decimal_places=2)

    def __str__(self) -> str:
        return self.title

```


``` python title="booklistapi/admin.py"
from django.contrib import admin
from .models import Book

# Register your models here.
admin.site.register(Book)
```


``` python title="booklistapi/views.py"
from rest_framework import generics
from .models import Book
from .serializers import BookSerializer


class BookView(generics.ListCreateAPIView):
    queryset = Book.objects.all()
    serializer_class = BookSerializer


class SingleBookView(generics.RetrieveUpdateAPIView):
    queryset = Book.objects.all()
    serializer_class = BookSerializer
```


``` python title="booklistapi/urls.py"
from django.urls import path
from . import views


urlpatterns = [
    path('books/', views.BookView.as_view()),
    path('books/<int:pk>/', views.SingleBookView.as_view()),
]
```


``` python title="booklistapi/serializers.py"
from .models import Book
from rest_framework import serializers


class BookSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    class Meta:
        model = Book
        fields = ['id', 'author', 'price']
```

### Connect the Little Lemon back-end to MySQL

### Set up Little Lemon booking API

``` python title="restaurant/views.py"
def bookings(request):
    date = request.GET.get('date', datetime.today().date())
    bookings = Booking.objects.all()
    booking_json = serializers.serialize('json', bookings)
    return render(request, "booking.html", {"bookings": booking_json})
```


``` python title="restaurant/ulrs.py"
from django.urls import path
from . import views


urlpatterns = [
    path('', views.home, name="home"),
    path('about/', views.about, name="about"),
    path('book/', views.book, name="book"),
    path('menu/', views.menu, name="menu"),
    path('menu_item/<int:pk>/', views.display_menu_item, name="menu_item"),
    path('bookings/', views.bookings, name="bookings"),
]
```


``` python title="restaurant/forms.py"
from .models import Booking
from django import forms


class BookingForm(forms.ModelForm):
    class Meta:
        model = Booking
        fields = "__all__"
```


### Coursera Notes

- Deployment process
    - To run an application in the Cloud, you need one or multiple servers to upload your application and link them to your domain. This process of uploading code and data to the servers is called Deployment
    - There are two types of deployment:
        - Manual: Need to manually upload everything using File Transfer Protocol (FTP), Secure File Transfer Protocols (SFTP), etc
        - Automated: Can be done with a version control system and build tools.
- It starts when the developer makes some changes and pushes code to the repository
- The build tools receive the signal and create a build environment identical to the production environment
- It runs the tests to ensure everything in your code is working correctly
- If everything is okay, the build tools connect to the server where your files will stay and upload your code



There are two important terms when it comes to deployment:

- Continuous Integration (CI): is the process of immitating the development environment and then running the test to ensure your code is okay

- Continuous Deployment (CD)


CI/CD Process:

- Code -> Version Control -> Build -> Test -> Deploy
