# What is cache?

This is the question that I keep asking myself whenever I read a tech article. Or has it ever happened to you that there's message popping up to require you clear your cache and BOOM! everything works pefectly fine? Because it does happen to me. 

## Definition
- A cache (pronounced as CASH) is hardware or software that is used to store something, usually data, temporarily in a computing environment.
- It's a small amount of faster, more expensive memory used to improve the performance of recently or frequently accessed data.
- Cache is commonly used by the central processing unit (CPU), applications, web browsers, and operating systems.


## How does cache work?
- When a cache client attempts to access data, it first checks th4e cache. If the data is found there, that is referred to as a cache hit. If it's not, it's referred to as a cache miss. The requested data is pulled from the main memory and copied into the cache.
- Web browser like Safari, or Chrome use browser caching to improve the performance of frequently accessed webpages. When a user visits a webpage, the requested files are stored in a chace for that browser in the user's computing storage.
- To retrieve a previously accessed page, the browser gets most of the files it needs from the cache rather than having them resent from the web server.


## How are cached used?
- Caches are used to store temporary files, using hardware and sofware components.
- Web browsers are a good example of application caching. Browsers have their own cache that store information from previous browsing sessions for use in future session
- A user wanting to rewatch a Youtube view can load it faster because the browser accesses it from cache when it was saved from the previous session


## What does clearing the cache do? 
- Every once in a while, a site will stop working, and clearing the cache will fix it. 
- Cached data can take up a lot of space on your machine sometimes. Therefore, if it's not set up to be cleared automatically, you'll have to do it yourself.
- If you suspect having a corrupted version of the app cached, you should clear your cache as well. 
- Afer your clear cache and cookies, some settings on sites get deleted. For example, if you were signed in, you need to sign in again. Some sites can become slower because content like images need to load again

## What are cookies that we usually accept?
- A cookie is a small file that's stored on a visitor's device and contains data specific to a particular user like their login information/authentication so tathy they don't have to manually log in each time.
- Cookies are only used to store text-based data, like IP addresses, sesssion IDs, visit histories, etc. 
- By asking for consent to use cookies, websites are giving users more control over their personal data and privacy.
- When you accpet cookies, you allow the website to remember you since it store a little bit of information on your device. 
- Cookies are used for various purposes such as personalization (theme choice, language selection, or items you added to your shopping card), tracking and analyitcs, and advertising.
