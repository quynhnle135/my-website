# Static Site Generators


## What is a static site generator?
- A static site generator is a software tool that generate HTML files for a website, using a set of templates. They comprise a variety of tools to make wesbites easier to create, design, update, and publish.
- Static site generators automate the process of coding individual HTML pages and prepare those pages for delivery ahead of time. Users' browsers will be able to load these HTML pages very quickly because they are pre-built.

## Why should we use a static site generator?
- Static site generators automate the process of coding individual HTML pages and prepare those pages for delivery ahead of time. Users' browsers will be able to load these HTML pages very quickly because they are pre-built.
- Users can customize their website or create any template they want. Also, because some static site generators provide basic template, it's easy for users to follow along and add more style if they want to, which is time saving and a huge plus if users don't have much experiences in front-end development or designing. 
- JAMstack (JAM stands for "JavaScript, APIs, Markup") is a methodology for efficiently creating lightweight, fast-performing web applications. JAMstack applications are static, with APIs used for any backend functionality. Static site generators enable developers to quickly build a JAMstack application frontend.
- It's also easy to deploy and publish the website made with static site genertor.
