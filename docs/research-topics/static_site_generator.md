- Users can customize their website or create any template they want. Also, because some static site generators provide basic template, it's easy for users to follow along and add more style if they want to, which is time saving and a huge plus if users don't have much experiences in front-end development or designing. 
- JAMstack (JAM stands for "JavaScript, APIs, Markup") is a methodology for efficiently creating lightweight, fast-performing web applications.
