# How to Persuade Anyone with Anything

## The Dale Carnegie's Ways
In his book "How to Win Friends and Influence People", there are two powerful ways that you have probably tried or encountered someone trying, and they work like magic: 
- It's about them, not you: 
    * In order to persuade anyone with anything, you need to make the benefit for the recieving party clear as day
    * We should consider others, not only ourselves: You need to speak about others and how it's going to benefit them, not yourself
    * We shouldn't live in our head most of the time: This means that you should try to make yourself as clear as possible, as if you are explaining something to someone with zero context; Seek feedback from the listeners to ensure they are still following or have any questions
- it's important to make them agree with you first when you persuade them

## Persuasions For Radical Changes
- There are three golden principles that anyone should follow if they want to make a radical change at work or in any organization in general:
    * Build credibility
    * Have the courage to admid that you're wrong: When you try to persuade people, you need to mention first where you can go wrong and be open to their suggestions of where things might go wrong
    * Present your ideas constantly, to increase likability: This starts from a research showing that the more we get exposed to something, the more likely we are to form a better idea about it.
