- Prioritize them: 
    * This doesn't mean that you have to go out of your way to do things for others all the time and put yourself last all the time
    * You should priortize the person you are trying to establish a good connection with over your personal desires
    * We can also prioritize work colleagues as well. You can do this by allocating time to assist junior employees who are new to the company, helping them acclimate to their surroundings, or simply inviting them for coffee or tea to ease their initial transition
    * We all have moments when we need to be lifted up, heard, and prioritized. So why not strive to be the person who extends a helping hand and prioritizes others as you wish someone had done for you?
- Keep an eye on the details: 
    * Showing empathy: Understanding the details of someone's situation, challenges, or goals allow you to empathize with them
    * Building trust: Building trusts strengthens the bonds you share with people
    * Personalized interactions: Whether it's remembering a friend's favorite hobbies or a colleague's preferred communication style, these small details matter.
    * Conflict resolution: Paying attention to these details can help prevent arguments from escalating and lead to more effective conflict resolution
    * Understand them: 
        * To genuinely understand anyone and to be able to put yourself in their shoes, all you need to do is listen.
        * You can try to listen attentively to what the person you're conversing with is conveying
        * You can ask clarifying questions, and adopt body language that demonstrates your interest, and maitain eye contact
- Don't expect immediate results
