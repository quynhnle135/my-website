# HTML, CSS, and JavaScript Overview

### What I Need To Know About HTML?
- HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) uses different tags and elements to identify what you see on screen. For examples:
    + <b>h1-h6</b>: If you want to add headings to your website
    + <b>p</b>: If you want to add paragraph
    + <b>li</b>: If you want to add hyperlink
- <mark><b>HTML helps you structure, layout your website and add content to it.</b></mark> It's typical to see that a website may be broken into many different sections such as header, navigation bar, body, and footer. 

<i>(*) HTML is not a programming language, because it lacks capability to perfom logic or algorithms which is a fundamental characteristic of programming languages.</i>
