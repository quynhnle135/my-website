# How To Use Marketing Techniques To Build A Better Resume

* Think like a marketer, which means that when you want to "sell" your resume, you have to ensure that your one-pager covers the basic features and benefits that would appeal to a specific persona (who may be recruiters or employers).
    
* The first filter for applications comes from an applicant tracking system (ATS) software that weeds out applicant resumes that don't have the keywords they are looking for.
    
* Build a base resume with your education, experience, and skills to this document regardless of how small.
    
* You should focus on technical skills when applying to technical roles, although there are some low proficiency skills, you should list them as well to highlight your ambition to learn new languages or technology outside your current role.
    
* Use the experience section to focus on the impact of your work and the soft skills you used to achieve. What did you do, how did you do it, but most importantly what was the outcome.
    

&rarr; In conclusion, when you're looking for a job, your potential customer is the hiring manager so the more thought you put into your resume, the better. By creating multiple resumes tailored for the various positions, industries, and company sizes that you're applying for, you'll have a better chance to get a call back and an interview.
