# Boost Your Career in Software Development with These 10 Essential Soft Skills

Technical skills are essential if you are a software developer. Still, no matter how good you are in the technical domain if you don't possess good soft skills, you will have a hard time at work. Here's a list of the top 10 soft skills every software developer needs to work on

---

## 1. Communication
- Good communication skills are required to foster teamwork as you must be able to communicate with your team members and project managers.
- You must be able to clearly communicate your views and respect your coworkers when it comes to sharing ideas and providing feedbacks.
- Successful communication requires that everyone is on the same page in term of timelines, project requirements, tasks, expectations, and many other things.
- To communicate well, you must also be a good listener. 
- Communication also includes a written like Slack message. Clear and concise writing skills are bonus points for communication.
 
 ### Key notes:
 * Speak your ideas and thoughts with clarity and confidence.
 * Be polite and never interupt the person speaking.
 * Listen with focus and be patient.
 * In written communication be straight to the point, write short messages, use proper grammer and punctuation, and format your message properly.

 ## 2. Teamwork
 - Software development has always been a collaborative effort.
 - Working as a team does not imply agreeing on everything. In fact, opposing viewpoints might be what propels businesses to success.
 - The concept of team is to achieve a balance and use your technical and soft skills to make the project as pleasurable and successful as possible for each member of thet team.
 - Being a team player means editing, refining, and developing your own ideas in conjunction with your team's ideas.

 ## 3. Learning Mindset
 - One of the best soft skills as a software developer you can have is a "student-for-life" mindset.
 - Continuous learning and study are excellent soft skills for a software engineer to have, whether it's picking up a new language or experimenting with new technology.

 ## 4. Work Ethic
 - Work ethic is basically the willingness and motivation to put in a lot of effort and pursue the best outcomes in your work.
 - While it displays your desire and eagerness to learn more and contribute in more places, becoming connected with other departments within your organization and other project teams can also reflect a strong work ethic.
 - Here's how poor work ethics look like: 
    * I'm done, I just have to fix this one thing (fixing it for a couple of days)
    * I was done with a task, but I discovered a new bug 
    * I am confused by this requirement, can someone explain this X thing to me (waiting the whole day to ask this on the next standup)
    * I had other things to do, meetings and administrative stuff
    * This task is really hard, my head hurts so much, and I am not sure how I will finish this (working on a simple tempalte-based task wasting as much time as possible to avoid picking the next task)

## 5. Organization and time management
- The ability to organize your day and do proper time management is a critical skill for a software developer.
- Knowing how to manage your time is essential when you have a lot on your plate:
    * How long are you in meetings?
    * How much time do you code?
    * How much time do you spend helping others?
    * How much time do you spend on utility stuff, emails, messages, collaboration, etc.
- You can concentrate on what's most important and complete activities more quickly when you have good time management skills
- Here's an example how to prepare the night before and making plan in advance:
    * First thing in the morning, I will quickly go through messages and emails, answer ones that are highly important.
    * As I am most productive during quiet moring hours I focus on completing a task of the highest importance, basically coffee and coding, with no interruptions.
    * Time for breakfast, a small break.
    * Meeting, collaboration, and coordination with the team
    * Lunch time.
    * More work, meetings
    * Finishing and wrapping up the day

## 6. Emotional intelligence and Empathy
- Developers with high emotional intelligence usually maintain composure under pressure, whereas those with poor emotional intelligence frequently communicate in a passive or hostile manner.
- Also, emotionally intelligent people are better at empathy and listening to constructive criticism.
- Those who lack emotional intelligence, on the other hand, struggle to collaborate, dismiss the opinions of others and don’t own up to their mistakes.
- Developers need to be able to empathize with individuals around them. Understanding the viewpoint of a non-developer, such as a designer, project manager, or quality assurance engineer, is another application of empathy.

## 7. Self-awareness
- When software engineer has healthy self-awareness, they are secure in what they know well and humble when given the chance to learn something new. Because they don’t let their insecurities hold them back, secure software developers have the highest chances of developing their careers.

## 8. Approachability
- People are more likely to work with you and not against you if you can establish a good relationship with them
- Approachability is a must-have skill for seniors and mentors so that other colleagues can talk to them and ask for help without hesitation.

## 9. Persistence and patience
- Finding errors in code can be really frustrating. As your early leads fall flat, you can be forced to go line by line through the code to find the issue, which calls for a lot of perseverance and patience.
- Usually, when a developer is in a neutral condition, they make the best decisions. Also, remaining composed in the face of disappointments contributes to the best possible outcome at the end of the day.

## 10. Confidenc
- Don't be afraid of tasks, googling solutions and Stack Overflow before even starting to work on the tasks. Don't be afraid to even start.
- Be okay with making mistakes, learning, and building your confidence step by step. You are an engineer and a problem-solver, and I just want that you give everything and do you best.
