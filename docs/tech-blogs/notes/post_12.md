title: How to Become a High-Performing Software Team
---

* Four major elements that enable high-performing teams:
    - Purpose creates autonomy
    - Decentralized decision-making fuels empowerment
    - High trust with psychological safety accelerates cohesion
    - Embracing encertainty sustains growth
* When developing software, our goal is not to develop software but rather to solve a problem and high-perfoming teams truly understand the problem they are trying to solve.
* Whether it's pushing code or determining what feature to build next, those decisions shouldn't be made two levels about the team; the teams need to make those decisions
* There's a difference between trust and psychological safety. Trust is how one feels towards someone or some group, whereas psychological safety is how one feels among the person or a group
* Embracing uncertainty sustains growths because in software industry, certainty is a delusional dream. This mindset embraces the uncertain reality we work in and allows us to become clever about our work, to grow as both individuals and teams
* Many times people feel they have to throw everything out and start again, when in reality this is the worst thing they could do because the level of violent change prevents any long lasting change from taking hold
