# 6 tips to write effective project updates as a software engineer

## 1. Know who your stakeholders are
- Most of the times, your stakeholders want to know when certain features be ready and they don't care about any databases or UI components &rarr; <b>Use the language they care about.</b>
- If you provide an update to EMs (Engineering Manager) or other engineers, you can use more technical focused language.

## 2. Break the project into milestones
- With Agile software engineering, you delivery your project in little chunks &rarr; Same with project updates, <b>break them into clear milestones</b>: sprints, product features, phases of a project, customer releases.

## 3. Provide a tldr; summary
- Your stakeholders may not have time to read all the details of your update, so you can help this by providing a tldr (too long didn't read); one-sentece summary of where the project is currently at and if you are still on track or not.

## 4. Raise awareness when you hit blockers
- If a project is running off the rails or taking longer than expected, don't hide that
- <b>Raise the alarm quickly and provide ideas for getting around said blockers</b> so your stakeholders and managers can make decisions to make sure the project is still successful.

## 5. Use bullet points format for updates
- Breaking things down into headings for the main sections, with bullet points for the details

## 6. Make sure you mention and include appropriate stakeholders
- Be sure to post your update where your identified stakeholders can read your update
- Directly mention specific people you want to make sure don't miss your update
