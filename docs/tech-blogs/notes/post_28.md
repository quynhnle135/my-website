## 2. Types of Data structures
- <b>Arrays - The backbone of efficient data management</b>:
    * You can access any element directly and fast by knowing its <b>index</b>
    * According to Stanford University, index-accessing feature makes arrays 30% fast for random access compared to other structures
    * However, arrays also have their limitations: their size is fixed (for most programming languages) so altering their length can be resource-intensive task
- <b>Linked Lists - Flexibility at its finest</b>:
    * If arrays require contiguous memory, Linked Lists require dynamic memory allocation, which makes them more flexible if you need to change their size.
    * However, if you want to traverse a linked list, it would be 20% slower that accessing elements in an array because of sequential access
- <b>Stack - Simplifying Last-In-First-Out Operations</b>: 
    * Because of its LIFO principles, stack is an excellent choice for applications like function call stacks, undo mechanisms, and expression evaluation
- <b>Queues - Mastering Sequential Processing</b>: 
    * Operating on First-In-First-Out principles
    * With distince front and rear access points, queues offer streamlined operations, making them indispensible in task scheduling, resource manager, and breadth-first-search algorithm
- <b>Trees - The Hierarchiacal Data Maestros</b>:
    * Because of their non-linear nature, trees allow efficient organization and retrieval of data, particularly in databases and file system
    * Trees are best utilized in scenarios requiring structured, hierarchical data organization, such as in database indexing or file system structuring.
- <b>Graphs - Interconnected Data Mapping</b>:
    * Graphs are adept at illustrating relationships between various data points through node (vertices) and edges (connections)
    * They shine in applications involving network topology, social network analysis, and route optimization
    * Graphs bring a level of interconnectedness and flexbility that linear data structures cannot match
    * Implement graphs for complex data sets where relationships and interconnectivity are key factors
- <b>Hash Tables: The Speedsters of Data Retrieval</b>:
    * Hash table stand out as a pinnacle <i>(peak, the most successful point)</i> of efficient data management, leveraging key-value pairs for swift data retrieval
    * Because it uses hash functions to map keys to specific slots, allowing for immediate access
    * However, you'll have to navigate the occassional challenge of <i>collisions</i>, where different keys hash to the same index

## 3. Array Data Structure
- Arrays store data elements of a single type in a sequential order, which are essential for managing multiple items collectively and systematically
- Array is crucial algorithm because it's quick to access values based on their indexes
- Arrays streamline tasks such as sorting, searching, and storing homogeneous data
- Each element in an array is like a compartment in a row of storage units, each marked with an indexs, which start from index zero.
- The <b><i>linear memory allocation</i></b> of arrays makes them a go-to choice for straightfoward data storage needs
- Key array operations:
    * Accessing elements
    * Inserting elements
    * Deleting elements
    * Traversing an array
    * Searching an array
    * Updating an array

## 4. Singly Linked List Data Structure
- Single linked list is like a sequence of train carriages connected in a line, where each carriage is an individual data element
- A linked list is a <b><i>sequential, dynamic collection</i></b> of elements termed as nodes. Each node points to its successor
- What does a linked list do?
    * The core functionality is its <b><i>sequential data arrangement</i></b>
    * Each node, containing data and a reference to next node, streamlines operations like <b><i>insertions and deletions, offering a highly efficient data management system</i></b>
- <b><i>The structure of a linked list</i></b> is built upon nodes. Every node consists of two parts: the data itself and a pointer to the next node
- <b><i>When are linked lists used?</i></b>: They are excellent in environments where data is frequently inserted of removed.
- Pros and cons:
    * Linked list's size is flexible and the efficiency of insertions and deletions
    * It can increase memory due to the storage of references and lack of direct element access

---

## 5. Double Linked List Data Structure
- Unlike its single-linked cousin, this structure gives nodes the luxury of knowing both their predecessor and successor, a feature that fundamentally changes how data can be traversed and manipulated.
- <b><i>What does a double linked list do?</i></b>
    * Double linked lists are the multitaskers of the data structure world, adept at forward and backward data navigation.
    * This structure enables users to step back and forth through elements with ease
- Same as the single linked list, double linked list also has key operations such as <b><i>adding, removing, finding, iteration, and updating</i></b>
-  <b><i>When are Double Linked Lists used?</i></b>: 
    * They can be used in systems where two-navigation is beneficial
    * They are used in browser histories, allowing users to move back and forth through previously visited sites
- Pros and cons:
    * Able to traverse back and forth
    * However, because each node requires two pointers, it leads to increasing memory consumption

---

## 6. Stack Data Structure
- A stack is a linear and ordered collection of elements that strictly adheres to the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principles, which means that <b>the last element added is the first one to be removed</b>.
- The fundamental purpose of stack is <b>store elements in an ordered and reversible manner</b>
- Key Stack operations: push, pop, peek, isEmpty, and search
- When are Stacks used?
    * Undo Features
    * Browser History: When you navigate backward or forward in your web browser, you're essentially traversing a stack of visited pages
    * Function call management
- Strengths: simplicity, efficiency, and predictability
- Weaknesses: 
    * Limited access: because you can only intereact with the top element
    * Memory constraints: stacks can run out of memory if pushed to their limits

---

## 7. Queue Data Structure
- Just like in real life, a queue data structure follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle, which means that <b>the first item added to the queue is the first to be processed</b>
- How do queues work: elements are added to the tail (end) and removed from the head (front) of the queue
- Key Queue Operations: 
    * Enqueue: adding elements to the tail
    * Dequeue: remove the elements from the head
- When are queues used?
    * Keyboard Buffers: When you type rapidly on your keyboard, the computer uses a queue to ensure that the characters appear on the screen in the order you pressed the keys.
    * Printer queues: In printing, queues are used to manage print jobs, ensuring that they are completed in the order they were initiated.
- Strengths: its ability to maintain order to ensure fairness and predictability in processing elements
- Weaknesses: Queues lack the ability to prioritize elements based on any criteria other than their arrival time

---

## 8. Tree Data Structure
- The Tree Data Structure's primary function is to arrange data hierarchically, creating a structure that mirrors real-world hierarchies.
- Nodes in a tree are linked through parent-child relationships, with a single root node at the top. Just as in a real family tree, information flows from the root to the leaves, creating a structured hierarchy.
- Key Tree operations:
    * Adding nodes 
    * Removing nodes
    * Traversing the tree: in-order traversal (LNR), pre-order traversal (NLR), and post-order traversal (LRN)
   
---

## 9. Graph Data Structure
- At its core, a graph represents a collection of nodes (or vertices) connected by edges - each node holding a piece of data, and edge signifying a relationship or connection
- How do Graphs work? Graphs function through nodes connected by edges
- Key operations in Graph data structures:
    * Adding a node (vertex)
    * Removing a node
    * Adding an edge
    * Removing an Edge
    * Finding neighbors
    * Graph Traversal: utilizing systematic methods such as DFS and BFS
    * Search operations
- When is the Graph data structure used? Graphs find their use in scenarios like modeling social network, database relationships, and routing problems
- Graphs are great for showing how things are connected. However, sometimes they are not the best choice because other data structures might do the job faster or with less hassle

## 10. Hash Table Data Structure
- Hash table (or dictionary in Python) is essential for optimizing data retrival and management.
- At their core, they store key-value pairs, enabling lightning-fast data retrieval
- Key Hash Table operations:    
    * Adding elements
    * Removing elements
    * Finding elements
    * Iterating over elements
- Time complexity:
    * Insertion, deletion, and finding take O(1) time complexity
    * Traversal operation takes O(n) time complexity dependent on the number of elements
- Space complexity: O(n)
- Advantages: Hash tables offer fast data access and efficient key-based retrieval

## 14. How to Optimize for Performance: Understanding Time Complexities in Data Structures
- Insertion: 
    * Can take up from O(1) to O(n)
    * For example: if you add an element at the front of the linked list, it would take only O(1) but taking up to O(n) if you adde to the end of the list
- Deletion: Can take up from O(1) to O(n)
- Searching: 
    * Can take up from O(1) to O(1)
    * Hash table only takes O(1) time complexity to search an element. However, a structure like trees or graphs may take up to O(n)
- Access Can take up from O(1) to O(n)
- Sorting: Can take up from O(nlogn) to O(n^2)
