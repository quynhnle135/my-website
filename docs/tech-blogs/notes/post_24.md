## 4. "Become the kind of leader that people would follow voluntarily; even if you have no title or position" - Brian Tracy
I worked with a senior team member who wasn’t a leader, but he was a very influential person. This is because he had the following traits:
- Very knowledgeable in a lot of domains.
- Approachable and welcoming every time you go to him with a question. Even if he doesn't have time now, he will always answer when he has the time.
- Kind; he doesn’t make people feel stupid even when they ask the most trivial question. Instead, he tries to guide them to the solution by asking questions, so they feel they got to the solution by themselves.
- The kind of person who would teach you how to fish instead of giving you a fish.
- Provides actionable and honest feedback.
- Trustworthy; when he says he’ll do something, he does it.
- Helps people out, even if they don’t ask.

## 5. "The challenge of leadership is to be strong, but not rude; be kind, but not weak; be bold, but not a bully; be thoughtful, but not lazy; be humble, but not timid; be proud, but not arrogant; have humor, but without folly" - Jim Rohn
- Strength without Rudeness:
    * True strength lies in the ability to assert oneself without resorting to rudeness. A leader should be assertive and decisive without demeaning others.

- Kindness without Weakness:
    * Kindness is a powerful leadership trait, applying a positive and supportive environment. Yet, it should not be mistaken for weakness. A leader can be compassionate and understanding while still maintaining authority and making tough decisions when necessary.

- Boldness without Bullying:
    * A good leader takes risks, stands firm in their convictions, and encourages innovation without resorting to intimidation or coercion.

- Thoughtfulness without Laziness:
    * Thoughtful leaders consider the implications of their decisions, weighing options carefully. However, this thoughtfulness should not lead to procrastination or indecision. Effective leaders act with purpose and efficiency.

- Humility without Timidity:
    * Humility is a hallmark of great leaders. They acknowledge their strengths and weaknesses, learn from mistakes, and appreciate the contributions of others. However, humility should not translate into timidity. Leaders must still be confident and assertive in their approach.

- Pride without Arrogance:
    * Taking pride in one's accomplishments is healthy, but arrogance can be detrimental. Leaders should celebrate achievements and take pride in their team's success while remaining open to feedback and continuous improvement.

- Humor without Folly:
    * A sense of humor can be a powerful tool in leadership, fostering a positive work environment. However, humor should never be at the expense of professionalism or used to downplay serious matters. It should contribute to a positive atmosphere without undermining the gravity of the work.
