# 10 Career Mistakes to Avoid as A Developer

1. You Don't Set Realistic Goals: 
    - Besides setting short-term goals, you should have long-term goals as well. Like, what do you want to be in the long-term in your career and how do you plan every step to achieve that goal. 
    - Additionally, it's important to prioritize the most important goals to you. That way, even if you cannot achieve some, you may identify a few more new goals along the way. 
2. You Fail to Recognize Your Potential: 
    - Knowing your potentials will improve your carreer. However, you may ask how to know you potential, that's where having a goal and working towards it helps. 
    - Try not to settle for unimportant things and constantly challenge yourself to produce better and more significant outcomes.
3. You Don't Take the Time to Network: 
    - Networking or socializing with like-minded people, talking to them, and getting inspired by their work as important as learning to code in programming. 
    - You can be active on platforms like LinkedIn, follow people you'd like to connect with and make authentic connections with them. Spending mindful time on these platforms, and at in-person events as you're able, can really help boost your career.
4. You Waste Your Precious Time: 
    - Wasting time here means not effectively utilizing your time. The best way to tackle is to switch off your phone's internet while working if you don't need it or you can set your phone in "Do Not Disturb" mode while your work needs your utmost attention.
    - Procastination is wasting time as well. Therefore you need to list out your distractors, break down your deliverables into smaller tasks, and take small breaks if needed. 
5. You Neglect Upskilling: 
    - Upskilling means getting better at your current skill or acquiring relevant new skills. It's essential to upskill at any and all stages of your career.
    - Although you may be busy with work or have your personal life, setting aside one hour to work on upskilling daily is enough to upskill. In this one hour, you can do:
        - Assess the gaps, weaknesses, and strengths in your technical and non technical abilities.
        - List them out in a place where you can easily get back to them and make modifications.
        - Prioritize them based on your current needs and near future goals.
        - Time-box each of the items so that you can get something tangible within a specified duration. For example, you want to do a certification on cloud computing within a month, or the Responsive Web Design course from freeCodeCamp over the next few weeks, and so on.
        - Start working on these defined tasks. You may find many resources on internet. Glance over them to create an index of resources that you can understand easily and relate to well.
        - Read and watch tutorials, but also practice hard.
        - Finally, recognize your progress.
6. You Don't Ask for What You Want: Oftentimes in your career journey, if you do not ask, you simply won't get what you want or deserve. If someone has some knowledge and you lack it, ask about it. If you have a question about something, ask before you commit to the work. Ask about your promotion, a salary hike, career growth, and anything that is related to your career. There is no such thing as a silly question when it comes to your career growth.
7. You Only Focus on the Money: Of course, money is important but when it comes to job switching, you should ask yourself these questions:
    - What will be my technical growth and learning opportunities?
    - What will the work environment be like? Remote/Work From Office/Hybrid? How will that impact me?
    - What skills (both tech and soft) will I be able to learn in the new position?
    - What kind of employee benefits will I get compared to my current organization?
    - Will my work-life balance be impacted positively?
    - What are the company's vision, culture, and values?
8. You Neglect Work-Life Balance: 
    - We all need to find a way to sustain both work and life. So plan ahead, and stick to your schedule as much as possible. There might be exceptions where you have to give one thing priority above another â€“ but do not allow the exception to become the norm.
9. You miss Out on Learning Opportunities: 
    - When we learn from someone, we not only come to understand what they've achieved or how they did it, but we also learn about the struggles, failures, and how they made the turnaround. 
    - Learning from someone else's experience can help accelerate your career journey. Don't make the mistake of living in a silo and missing out on these opportunities.
10. You Can't See the Bigger Picture: 
    - By Big Picture (or Bigger Picture), I mean understanding and developing a wider perspective on your career as a whole. 
    - It is about your ability to consider and assess many different aspects of a situation, rather than focusing on just the minute details. 
    - Along with understanding "what" tasks you need to perform, also ask "why" your tasks are important and how they will impact the rest of the project or other people's work.
