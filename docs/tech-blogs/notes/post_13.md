# 10 hard-to-swallow truths they won't tell you about software engineer job

## 1. College will not prepare you for the job
- The college will prepare you for some basics, but what most of the colleges teach is so far away from day-to-day jobs.
- The university curriculums are heavily outdated. They trot years behind the software development market needs.
- You have to put in extra work while you are in college. Code more projects besides homework and seminars.
- Do some volunteering and learn about business domains to prepare for the job that awaits you.

## 2. You will rarely get greenfield projects
- In day to day job, you are working with projects that contain multiple layers and thousands of lines of code. Multiple people work at the same time on those projects.
- You have limited freedom, you have to adapt to the project.
- Sometimes you spend a whole week fixing the nasty bug, although it turns out that the fix is just a couple of lines of code. 
- You talk to you colleagues and exchange information about the project and collaborate with them to get approval for your solution

## 3. Nobody cares about your clean code
- People expect you to write good and clean code, but they rarely compliment you on it.
- As a software engineer, your primary task is to generate value for users. Writing code is just a step that accomplishes that goal
- You can think of it as the following cycle:
    * software engineer writes code
    * users get new features
    * more users use your products
    * company profits from products

## 4. You will sometimes work with incompetent people
Here are some advices to work with incompetent people:
- Try to be efficient and productive as much as you can, focus on yourself and not on them
- Try other options or solutions that don't involve that person in the process
- Document everything you do. If things go wrong, you will have proof of their incompetence
- If you have a blocker because that person didn't do their job, try to ask someone else to unblock you
- Talk directly to them, be professional but not mean, and tell them what and how they can improve


## 5. Get used to being in meetings for hours
- Meeings are an important part of the software development job. Some of them are good, but some of them are just time wasters.
- There are productive meetings, which ensure information exchange between team members or different teams
- Your job is also to communicate about things openly and proactively
- Sharing information is crucial for projects to move forward. When you share information it can help other teams to better undestand what you are doing and the opposite

## 6. They will ask you for estimates a lot of times
- It's always good to underpromise but overdeliver.

## 7. Bugs will be your arch-enemy for life
- Bugs can come from your own code, third party libraries, hardware failure, or even electricity.
- You should assume that everything has bugs. That's why experienced devs never trust their code if it runs successfully on the first try.

## 8. Uncertainty will be your toxic friend
Here are some examples of uncertainty:
- implementing something in your project you never worked with, eg. 3rd party API - how are you going to implement something you aren't familiar with
- transfer to a new project, with new technologies - you will think about how you are going to be efficient and productive with something you need to learn
- move to a new company - you are unsure how you are going to settle in and vibe with new people
- bug report on the day you need to finish the work - you fear that you are gonna break the deadline
- job security - economic situations, pandemics, wars, and other factors heavily affect this industry which results in layoffs
- the evolution of technology - you are never sure if tomorrow you are gonna be replaced by some new technologies like AI

The good thing about uncertainty is that drives you to be a better software engineer. It demands improvements and learning if you want to stay in the game.

## 9. It will be almost impossible to disconnect from your job
Therefore, here are some ways to avoid:
So to avoid all this:
- I turn off my laptop after I am done with the work,
- I put quiet hours on my mobile phone for my business emails
- I pause Slack notifications after working hours. I disable them on weekends.
- When my mind gets into this "think about work" loop, I try to immediately cut it out. I remind myself that rest and relaxation are important to be productive.
- I take long walks after work. On some days I do sports like padel or football.
- I try to engage socially as much as I can, avoiding screen time after work.

## 10. You will profit more from good soft skills thatn from good technical skills
- Some soft skills that you should have besides your technical skills: communication, teamwork, learning mindset, organization and time management, emotional intelligence and empathy, approachability, persistence and patience, and confidence.
