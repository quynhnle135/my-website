# Making a Good Engineer a Great One: Training Your Skills and Training Your Mindset

I would separate the process of learning new skills into 3 phases: 
1. Adjustment phase - when starting in a new position, we obviously lack the experience and familiarity with best practices. That's why we begin by learning rules that guide us.
2. Intuition-building phase - as we learn by doing, acting on rules is replaced with acting on intuition. Be careful not to confuse intuition with overconfidence.
3. Stagnation phase - once we've mastered our new responsibilities, do we push onward or move on to something new?

## Adopting the Growth Mindset
- In order to grow, we need to push ourselves outside our comfort zone and beyond our capabilities

### 1. Adjustment phase
- One of the hardest challenges I've faced so far - transitioning to engineering management - shook my perception of software engineering
- Transitoning to engineering management meant I would focus big chunks of my time on new types of problems.
- Instead of valuating myself based on my own contributions, I have to do it through my team.
=> Understand that imposter syndrome is a natural occurence when taking on new responsibilities. All we need to do is keep pushing, let the new neural pathways start to form, and things will start going our way. 

### 2. Intuition-building phase
- At some point, we stop feeling stuck and things aren't as hard as they used to. However, this is a phase in which we might fall prey to overconfidence - where we overestimate our skills due to lak of expertise.
- To raise our level of expertise, we must build an intuition about the best ways to solve our new challenges. 
- We start off by learning rules given to us by mentors, colleagues, and other people with relevant experience. Only by experimenting and collecting timely feedback can we train or brains to intuit solutions beyond given rules.
=> Don't fall into the trap of overconfidence; keep pushing and looking for feedback

### 3. Stagnation phase
- Talk with your mentors and peers about possible next steps, and stay true to what's important to you. 
- Ideally, we can align our career progression with our professional goals, and learning about all the possibilities helps use make more informed decisions. 


### Good news: Learning has a compound effect
- By understanding what challenges lie ahead and that it's all a natural part of the process, we can learn to appreciate them.
- As we continue growing, new challenges become easier to tackle, like the snowball effect of layering skills.
- Learning how to communicate with engineers will make learning how to communicate with business people somewhat easier to do, which will make learning presentation skills easier.
