# How Your Emotions Are Born and How They Work

## Emotions are constructed
- Simulations can manifest visually or through oterh sensory inputs, such as the persistent song playing in your head - a form of audio simulation
> In every waking moment, you’re faced with ambiguous, noisy information from your eyes, ears, nose, and other sensory organs. Your brain uses your past experiences to construct a hypothesis — the simulation — and compares it to the cacophony arriving from your senses. In this manner, simulation lets your brain impose meaning on the noise, selecting what’s relevant and ignoring the rest.

### What is a concept?
- A concept is a tool that your brain uses to create meaning or a translation of things around you. 
- Without a concept, every sensory input around you will seem like noise 
- For example: When you see a bee, if you've been biten by it before, you may have a concept of the bee as a dangerous creature. However, if you have read and seen bees as beautiful creature and help the enviroment, you may feel more comfortable and it has such an approachable concept to it.
> With concepts, your brain simulates so invisibly and automatically that vision, hearing, and your other senses seem like reflexes rather construction
- Concepts also create meaning for the tastes and smell we encounter. For example, you most likely assume that pink ice creams are strawberry-flavored.
> In every waking moment, your brain uses past experience, organized as concepts, to guide your actions and give your sensations meaning. When the concepts involved are emotion concepts, your brain constructs instances of emotion.'

### Debunking myths about emotions
#### Emotions are triggered
> Emotions are not reactions to the world. You are not a passive receiver of sensory input but an active constructor of your emotions. From sensory input and past experience, your brain constructs meaning and prescribes action.
- Researchs show that there is no such thing as emotions triggering. In different situations, humans construct various type of emotions.
- Emotions are created by your brain on the fly; whenever you experience something, your brain attempts to make sense of it rapidly, drawing from your past experiences, culture, identity, and your worldview.
=> Emotions cannot be triggered but created by the brain when exeperiencing new things or specific situations.

#### Emotions have fingerprints
> Emotions are made, not triggered; emotions are highly variable, without fingerprints; and emotions are not, in principle, distinct from cognitions and perceptions.
- Your usual emotional concepts are ingrained solely due to your upbringing in a specific social environment where these emotions hold significance and utility. Your brain automatically employs them, often without your awareness, to construct your perceptions
- While changes in heart rate are inevitable, the emotional interpretation attached to them is not fixed. Different cultures can assign varied meanings to the same sensory input.

### Emotions are predicted from facial expressions
> We don’t recognize emotions or identify emotions: we construct our own emotional experiences, and our perceptions of others’ emotions, on the spot, as needed, through a complex interplay of systems.
- Emotions can’t be “recognized” or “detected” based on the facial expressions of others because they simply don’t have a fingerprint that is waiting to be found.

### So how are emotions made?
- Social construction
- Psychological construction
- Neuroconstruction

Key points and takeaways:
- Basically, emotions are constructed by the upbringings, the media we are around, or the images that adults teach us when we were a kid. Colors make it easier for the brain to engage and have simulation.
- We have all something called "concept" in our mind. To my understanding, it's like the assumption you have towards things and situations. To make it easier to understand, remind yourself of the bee and ice cream examples. 
    * If a child was taught about being careful around bees because they may sting or he/she had an experience of being stung by a bee, they would have a dangerous or alert concept of a bee. 
    * As an ice cream example, we may assume every pink may have strawberry flavor because most strawberry flavor food is pink so we develop that concept around it.
- There are three main myths (things that people think they are true but not really) about emotions:
    * Emotions are triggered: No, emotions cannot be triggered and they are not your reactions to the world. Sensory inputs and past experiences create emotions. Emotions are made, not triggered.
    * Emotions have fingerprints: This concept is hard to understand for me. Emotions can be unique and different in every one ( you can think that my anger doesn't look like your anger), they are made and they don't stay or reside in our brain permanently. 
    * Emotions are predicted from facial: Emotions cannot be recognized or detected based on facial expressions but they are <b>perceived</b>. Behind emotion shaping is facial expression, heart rate, or blood pressure, etc.
