# The complete roadmap for backend engineering
I often get asked questions like:
- What should I learn next to level up in my career?
- What backend skills am I missing that I need to be a senior engineer?
- How do I break into my first tech role?

## 1. Basic of the internet
You should learn some of the basics of the internet:
* How does the internet work?
* What is HTTP?
* Browsers and how they work?
* DNS and how it works?
* What is a Domain Name?
* What is hosting?

## 2. Pick a backend language
- Next step is to choose a backend programming language to learn. A programming language will be used to develop and maintain the business logic and core features of an application. Top four languages would be Javascript, Java, Python, and PHP
- Once you learn the language, then you can pick up a framework to help you develop backend applications quicker and with good patterns or structure in that language:
    * Javascript - Node.js, Express.js, etc
    * Java - Spring, Struts, Google Web Toolkit
    * Python - Django or Flask
    * Php - Laravel

## 3. Everything version control
- Learning how to version control your code is a life-saver
- Git is a version control system that developers use all over the world. It helps you track different versions of your code and collaborate with other developers

## 4. OS and General knowledge
- In order to understand how computers and servers work, it will be helpful for you to study in general how operating systems work
- Some things you'll want to research include: 
    * Terminal commands
    * POSIX Bascis
    * Memory Management
    * Threads and Concurrency
    * Process management
    * Basic networking concepts

    * Interprocess communication

## 5. Relational databases
