# Understanding the waterfall methodology


## 1. What is the waterfall methodology?
- The waterfall methodology is a linear and sequential project management approach where each phase of a project must be completed before moving to the next.
- It emphasizes thorough documentation, well-defined project requirements, and a structure, predetermined timeline.

## 2. Core principles of the waterfall methodology
- The waterfall methodology utilizes three core principles: sequential phases, defined requirements, and an emphasis on documentation.
- <b>Sequential phases:</b> A project id divided into distince phases and each phase must be completed before the next one begins.
- <b>Defined requirements:</b> The project must be planned and the requirements must be known and well-defined. This means a significant portion of the overall project time is spent on requirement gathering, analyzing, and documenting requirements.
- <b>Emphasis on documentation:</b> Comprehensive documentation helps with planning and executing the project. It is needed: 
    * To caption and clarify the project requirements
    * To support communication and collaboration with the customers
    * To design and implement the project
    * To ensure the quality and coordinate the team efforts
    * To verify if the team is on track and the project meets the specifications
    * To share knowledge especially when topics are handed over in between project phases


## 3. Phases of the waterfall methodology
### Requirements phase
- The requirements phase is the initial step in every waterfall project as it lays the foundation for the project plan and the following work. Key activities in this phase include: 
    * Conducting user interviews
    * Conducting stakeholder and customer interviews
    * Executing requirement workshops
    * Documenting requirements
    * Defining acceptance criteria, quality metrics, and nonfunctional requirements
    * Defining a project plan with concrete project goals, a resource plan, a test plan, and a communication plan
    * Gathering the needed budget and resources for the project
    * Gaining feedback from the customers and the stakeholders to move on with the design phase


### Design phase
- After the requirements are clear and the project is planned, the project team can start with the design phase. 
- In the design phase, the focus lies on creating a detailed design and architecture based on the defined requirements.
- Key activities in this phase include:
    * Developing the architectural plan and creating blueprints
    * Creating detailed design documents, including models, user interfaces, and workflows
    * Identifying dependencies between different components and creating component integration plans
    * Updating project plans as more is learned
    * Testing the designs against the documented requirements


### Implementation phase
- During this phase, the team begins the actual work.
- Key activities in this phase include: 
    * Developing code and creating software components
    * Conducting code reviews, tests, and creating unit tests
    * Integrating different components and modulus to a bigger system
    * Creating the system and integration tests
    * Manually testing the system and its parts
    * Ensuring that the implementation is aligned with the designs and architectural requirements
    * Ensuring that the implementation is also aligned with the requirements of the stakeholders
    * Budget monitoring and ensuring that the project is on track and in scope
- In the implementation phase, the team needs to be careful and pay attention to details, while also adhering to the design and requirements

### Verification phase
- This phase focuses on testing and quality assurance with the stakeholders and users.
- It is used to identify and rectify defects and ensure that the project meets all requirements and quality standards.
- Key activities in this phase include:
    * System testing to evaluate the overall functionality and performance
    * Load testing
    * User acceptance testing
    * Regression testing to check for unintended side effects of code changes
    * Bug tracking and fixing the bugs
    * Final approval and handover to the customers


### Maintenance phase
- This phase begins after the product is deployed and in active by its intended users
- Key activites in this phase include:
    * Monitoring the system and identifying potential issues
    * Addressing and resolving defects, errors, and bugs
    * Implementing updates and delivering them based on user feedback
    * Ensuring the operation and sustainability of the system

## 4. Pros and cons of the waterfall methodology
- Pros: Predictability, good documentaion, clear milestones, stakeholder involvement
- Cons: Late feedback, excessive documentation, limited flexibility, late value creation, risk of overlooking major issues, expense repairs,

## 5. Waterfall vs Agile
- Waterfall is suitable for projects with stable, well-defined requirements and organizations with a preference for predictability
- Agile approaches excel in dynamic environments where flexibility, collaboration, and rapid adaption are crucial

## 6. Tools for water project management
- Project management software: Tools like Microsoft Project help in planning, scheduling, and tracking project activities
- Requirements management: Tooks like Jira can help manage and track project requirements and bugs
- Version control: Version control systems like Git are essential for managing code changes and ensuring traceability
- Collaboration platforms: Tools like Microsoft Teams, Slack, and Confluenece enable seamless communication and document sharing among team members
