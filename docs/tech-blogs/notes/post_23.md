# 10 Steps to Earn Your Team's Trust As a Software Engineer

## 1. Do your research
- Before proposing any changes or initiatives to your team, make sure you conduct thorough research
- Here are some questions you can ask yourself when doing some researches:
    * Is your proposal feasible?
    * What are the expected outcomes?
    * Are there any dependencies involved?
    * How will it impact existing dependencies?
    * Does the value outweigh the time investment?
=> The more prepared you are, the more credibility you'll accrue over time, and your colleauges will trust your expertise

## 2. Assist in overcoming obstacles
- Build a comprehensive understanding
- Articulate your ideas clearly
- Aid in troubleshooting problems
- Offer feedback
- Become an expert
=> The more you solve problems in the team and help people solve problems, the more you become reliable, approachable

## 3. Don't require constant reminders
- Reevaluate the task requirements to determine their relevance and the potential need for updates
- Scope the task
- Assess the impact
- Investigate dependencies
- Create a clear "Definition of done"
=> Inform your team when you take on a task, and address all the questions about these points. Involving your colleagues in the process can help them understand and relate to the changes you're implementing

## 4. Don't abadon ship: Continuously monitor deployment
After a project ship, it’s crucial to remain vigilant. 
- Be alerted: Regularly check alerts, logs, and metrics, especially for impactful changes. 
- Be Proactive: This approach helps avoid situations where others must remind you to investigate alerts or errors because of your changes.
- Be transparent: Make the team aware if anything major happens. You can do this by opening an incident (ticket or whatever the company names it) to investigate the issue transparently.
- Be collaborative: Give the team a chance to collaborate with you to help resolve the issue.
=> Helping you take ownership of any issues that arise and promptly addressing them is a powerful way to gain trust

## 5. Avoid hasty rejection and provide alternatives
- In discussions or decision-making processes: It’s essential not to reject ideas without substantial evidence outright. 
- Find solutions: Instead of using phrases like “We can’t do this” or “This is not possible,” employ a more constructive approach, like “We can try experimenting 1,2,3,” “How about we fix this by 1,2,3”.
- Define the blockers: State that a task is possible but needs prioritization due to certain factors or suggest reconsidering specific aspects.
=> You are a problem solver, not just a programer. So act like one. People should perceive you as the fixer, not a complainer

## 6. Offer solutions, not just complains
- Don’t just complain: Rather than simply voicing dissatisfaction, strive to present solutions. If you encounter an issue, propose ways to address it.
- Be a fixer: Fix things that you don’t like instead of complaining about them.
- Make code better than you found: clean it, remove unused code, and make it more abstract and readable.
- Seek help: In cases where you can’t devise a solution on your own, organize meetings to brainstorm ideas or engage others in collaborative problem-solving.
=> This approach will reveal your potential gaps in your thinking and expand your horizons through the collective wisdom of your team

## 7. Seek feedback and communicate your goals
- Seek guidance by inviting seniors' valuable feedbacks and fosters a professional relationship grounded in effective communication
- Find mentors
=> The feedback you receive becomes a vital mirror reflecting your work and helps guide your progress towards your goals, highlighting areas that may require further attention

## 8. Stay organzied and promote collaboration
- Don't multitask
- Don't wait for your changes to be reviewed: Ask people directly to review your PRs
- Think out loud and share knowledge
=> Thinking out loud, sharing knowledge, inviting others to collaborate and adding value to the team by active collaboration, will set you up for success

## 9. Mentor and support newcomers
- Ask for the opportunity, don't wait for it: Involve yourself in the onboarding process for new team members. Be proactive and let them know you want to mentor the next new member
- Gain self-overview and self-confidence
=> The benefits include a deeper understanding of your own knowledge, identification of knowledge gaps, and the development of skills required to guide others.

## 10. Actively partcipate in team discussions
- Be active, listen attentively, don't interupt, and ask questions
=> Silence can often be perceived as a label of “unknown,” potentially hurting trust and understanding.
