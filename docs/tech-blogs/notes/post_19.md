# 3 differences between software engineers and engineering managers

**Software Engineer:**

- **Technical Decision Making**: Act as a technical expert, making decisions on feature implementation, upholding technical standards, and advocating for the product's long-term technical strategy.
- **Impact and Visibility**: Essential for promotion. Achieved by influencing the technological estate, envisioning and realizing projects, measuring impact, and ensuring visibility of contributions.
- **Instant Gratification**: Realized through immediate results like functioning code or passing tests.

**Engineering Manager:**

- **Guidance Over Decision Making**: Should guide the team but not make technical decisions. Asking key questions like scalability and latency considerations empowers the team's creativity and expertise.
- **Impact on People and Team**: Focus on delivering business impact through the team. Ensuring team happiness and drive, providing focus and boundaries, and enabling trust are key to business value.
- **Delayed Gratification**: Changes and successes in team management and development may take time to manifest, making gratification less immediate compared to technical roles.
- **Avoid Making Technical Decisions**: Direct involvement in technical decisions can reduce the team to mere executors, underutilizing their collective skills and creativity.

### Key Takeaways:

- **Software Engineers** are expected to be hands-on with technology, make crucial technical decisions, and have mechanisms for instant gratification.
- **Engineering Managers** should focus on guiding and nurturing their team, enabling them to make technical decisions, with their success often seen in the longer term through team performance and development.
- Both roles require impact and visibility but differ in their approach: **Software Engineers** impact through direct technical contributions, while **Engineering Managers** through team and people management.
