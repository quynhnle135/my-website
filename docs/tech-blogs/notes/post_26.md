# Mastering the Art of Meetings - Turning Boredom into Career Growth Opportunities

## How to make any meeting enjoyable and beneficial
- Asking questions even if you fear that others might perceive you as unintelligent
- Asking follow-up questions: Avoid nodding and sayin yes if you haven't grasped the answer
- Listening attentively to whatever discussed in the meeting
- Making efforts to get involved in tasks that may not align directly with your current responsibilities
- If you don't contribute at all and keep your thoughts to yourself, you won't be aware of your areas for improvement
- Be conscious that senior individuals are not always right
- Don't hesitate to challenge more seniors and experienced colleagues

## The meetings can be useful to you
- You shouldn't waste your time with back-and-forth conversation that may last for an hour
- It's the best to jump on 15-minute call to resolve the issue during: 
    * Pull Request reviews
    * Solving a complicated incident
    * Explaining something to someone or helping them out in general 
- By doing the above, it will give you the opportunity to 
    * learn from others
    * teach someone something
    * don't get intimidated to explain things to seniors
    * communicate effectively with other team members, so you eliminate any assumptions about them or assumptions they made of you

- Increase your incredibility: Showing the teams your work and how useful it is
- Help you become a go-to person
- Engage by commenting or asking questions
- Try to critically think about what's being said, don't just take the information as it is - helps you and others identify gaps
