# Manage your capacity, not your time

## Capacity Allocation
- You should aim for allocating a default workload that is not your full capacity, purposefully leaving some portion of your time unallocated. This is because you need to leave space for the unexpected, such as escalations, meetings, and other interruptions that will inevitably arise
- Make sure you're always available for your team when they need you

## Energy: Increasing and Decreasing Your Capacity
- You are only able to allocate as much time to your tasks as your capacity allows
- Your energy levels effect your total capacity:
    * Your capacity has a fixed upper bound, which is the number of hours in a day that you are able to work effectively
    * Your capacity depletes when you are spending time on tasks that drain your energy.
    * You capacity replenishes when you are spending time on tasks that energize you
- Therefore, you should be mindful of your energy levels as they directly effect the quality of your work


## Log Your Week
- In order to better understand the relationship between your capacity and your energy levels, it's useful to keep a log of how you are spending your time and how you feel.
- Here is the exercise you can do to find out your capacity:
    * For the next week, at the beginning, middle and end of each day, log what you feel that your energy level is on a scale of 1-10. 1 is completely drained, and 10 is completely energized. You can use a spreadsheet, a notebook, or whatever works for you.
    * Alongside each log entry, jot down what you have been doing in the last few hours. This could be meetings, 1:1s, deep work, or anything else.
    * At the end of each day, note how many hours of productive work that you did. This can be deep work or meetings where you thought you were effective.
    * At the end of the week, take a look at your log. What patterns do you see? Are there any activities that are consistently draining your energy? Which activities increase it?
    * How did you feel about your capacity by the end of the week? Was Friday an unfocussed slog, or was it a day of high productivity? Can you see a relationship between your energy levels, the type of tasks that you were doing, and your capacity? What can you do next week to improve your capacity?
