# Unpopular Opinion: It's harder than ever to be a good software engineer.


### What does it mean to be an engineer? 
As a software engineer, we are: 
- Responsible for translating complex problems into efficient and scalable solutions
- Tasked with analyzing user requirements, designing software architecture, writing code, and testing and debugging software
- Expected to stay on top of trends, seeking new business opportunities and ways to improve existing products

### What does it mean to be a good engineer?
- A good engineer is one that efficiently focuses their effort to bring maximum value in achieving a goal

### Growing markets and competitions
- The tech market is constantly evolving. To succeed on such an environment, companies needed to "move fast and break things"
- By moving away from the core principle – how can we bring more value to our customers – and moving towards beating the competition on the hype train, we get engineers building functionalities that are doomed to fail.

### World is a confusing place
- Programming languages and constant releases of new frameworks also add to the confusion along with the new wave of change brought by ChatGPT, Github Copilot, and other emergin tech.
- However, don't get sucked into the hype, which is a rookie mistake. Knowing many tools, frameworks, and languages is nice but it cannot replace experience.
- Don't get caught up in new trends and hypes to the point where you lose focus on bringing value.

### Fast pace and high expectations
- When seeking new challenges, it can be difficult to strive for positive stress, while avoiding negative stress. 
- Positive stress is one where we perceive a stressful situation as an opportunity leading to a good outcome, while negative stress is one that can have detrimental physical and mental health effects, as seen in the image below.
- Pressure is higher than ever, coming both from within and without. Stay focused and surround yourself with a supportive team optimizing long-term.

### How can we do better? 
- Individually, stay true to what is really important. Technologies will come and go, but the value you bring to the world is what counts. It’s hard to fake hard work and experience.
- As a company, start with why when making decisions. This is the best way to deliver functionalities that will bring value. Also, make sure the employees know that why. In my experience, they will make better decisions, give valuable feedback and be happier.
- Culturally, establish processes that will support the employees, optimizing long-term. Together with your colleagues establish a culture of trust, support and caring. That way, you will all get the best of one another.
