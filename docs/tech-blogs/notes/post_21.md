# A good engineer thinks like a product manager

## The importance of product mindset for engineers
- Because users don't care how shiny the tech and only care if the product is solving their problems or not, the focus on the product is very important.

## Our goal is to create solutions that customers are going to love
- "Why are we building this thing?" - this is one of the great questions to ask, before starting to implement a new functionality. It gives you insights and motivation behind it.
- Being curious about the product and the business will enable you to create great technical solutions that customers are going to love.

## How to get better at being product-minded?
- Pair with non-tech people:
    * When you're creating different solutions, you often need some clarification about certain things. 
    * Instead of going to your manager or your team members, try to get more details from people who are in other department like finance, sales, marketing, compliance, etc
- Explain technical solutions to non-tech people:
    * If you can explain a technical solution in a way that is understandable to non-tech people, you are automatically on a good path to being product-minded.
    * That means that you understand the technical solution well and you can also explain it with simple words
- Ask business, product and customer-related questions before making a technical decision:
    * Asking the right questions will ensure that we are making the right technical decisions and ultimately building the right things. This can save a LOT of time.
- Talk directly with the customer: 
    * Help you gain insight into the problem your customers are facing
    * You are able to create a lot better technical solutions by understanding their requirements
- Do freelance work
- Take on different roles:
    * Those include frontend, backend, DevOps, system infrastructure, as well as QA
    * It's helpful since you can understand different fields which help you make a better long-term and big-picture decision

## Simplify as much as possible
- Before you start implementation, try to simplify ot as much as possible. 
- Think about how we can deliver it faster to the users
