# How to quickly learn a new framework or a technology

## Learning is hard, and we already have enough on our plate
- Here are some reasons people struggle to learn new things:
    * We don't have time
    * We aren't sure where to start
    * We are comfortable with what we know
    * We purchase a tutorial but never finish it

## Enter the Feynman Technique
- He offered a four step process for learning anything new:
    * Pick a topic and study it thoroughly
    * Teach it to yourself and someone else
    * Go back to the source material to review and refine your understanding
    * Simplify you explanations

### Step 1: Read the official docs, grab a book, etc
- Start with the official docs or google search to get a basic overview of the topic you want to learn
- You could take a course or read a book to dive in deeper in your understanding once you have done a basic overview

### Step 2: Try it out
- Start prototype and trying out what we know so far
- It's important to try things out as you are reading and learning.
- Don't just copy and paste from a tutorial or a book.
- Try to add another feature or switch something up

### Bonus step: Do more reading and research
- Because learning is a very iterative process, you should be going back and forth between trying things out and doing more research
&rarr; Iterative learning helps you take things step by step, rather than trying to learn everything upfront and execute it perfecly

### Step 3: Get it working
- Try to get each small piece working one at a time &rarr; Sit back, take a break, and review your progress.
- Commit your work with git, so you have a good copy working copy of your project

### Step 4: Refactor
- After you've got things working, take some time to clean up 
&rarr; Break things out into smaller components and utility files to keep things nice and maintainable, extensible, and easy to understand

### Step 5: Summarize and document
- After shipping the product with out documenting anything, you may forget what you've done and learned
&rarr; Take what you've learned and done and summarize it in your own words. Make sure you organize your notes and revisit them regularly for maximum learning retention

### Step 6: Share what you've learned
- This is the final step to really lock in your learning, and help you remember it for a long time to come.
- Now that we’ve summarized what we’ve learned let’s share it with others.
    * Did they understand your notes and explanations?
    * Try to use analogies to connect your new learnings to other topics you both already know.
    * Try to explain it in simple enough terms that a 12 year old could understand it
