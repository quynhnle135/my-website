# Front-End Review

- When it comes to making or building a website, there are three main blocks contributing to it which are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

### What I Need To Know About HTML?
- HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) uses different tags and elements to identify what you see on screen. For examples:
    + <b>h1-h6</b>: If you want to add headings to your website
    + <b>p</b>: If you want to add paragraph
    + <b>li</b>: If you want to add hyperlink
- HTML helps you structure, layout your website and add content to it. It's typical to see that a website may be broken into many different sections such as header, navigation bar, body, and footer. 
- <b>HTML is not a programming language, because it lacks capability to perfom logic or algorithms which is a fundamental characteristic of programming languages.</b>


### What I Need To Know About CSS?
- CSS (Cascading Styole Sheets) adds style to your website. You can make each tag and element in HTML looks unique and different in sizes, styles, or colors. For examples:
    + backgroud-color: If you want to change the background's color
    + display: If you want to adjust how the block of content in HTML displayed. It can be <i> block, inline, flex, etc...</i>
    + Box models: Each element in HTML can also be considered as a box which has margins, borders, padding, and content. With CSS, you can adjust the size of these elements too. 
    + Layout techniques: Flexbox, frid, and positioning help you organize and layout your web pages better. 
    + Responsive: This feature helps your website look good on all devices (desktops, tablets, and phones).
- Like HTML, CSS is not a programming langugage either because it doesn't have the capability to perform logic or algorithms.
