# Ownership makes careers

- Money doesn't motivate:      
    - Early in your career, money is a huge motivator. Because you don't have much and money is nice
    - Somewhere around the 180k to 250k income level, your relationship with money changes &rarr; Your basics are taken care of, you're saving plenty enough, and more money feels like throwing a twig on the pile &rarr; It doesn't meaningfully chnage anything.
- You have to put your name on priojects before they succeed. <b>Own the outcome</b>, not the work. Stake your reputation on something and make it happen. 
- Objetion: <b>But I don't have real ownership</b>
    - Yes, you need real ownership. That's what makes this fuzzy ownership stuff worth your time.
    - You get real ownership by exhibiting the other type of ownership. Via promotions, bonuses, and better offers. The higher up you go, the more of your compensation comes in equity. 
- Objection: <b>But I'm not incentivized to care</b>
    - Change jobs &rarr; You want a job that rewards great work. Creating your own is the ultimate version of this.
- Question: <b>What if nobody wants to give ownership</b>
    - The phrase is <b>take ownership</b>
    - Ownership is rewarded when things are going poorly and need someone to step up &rarr; You should step up when you see something needs help or taking care of.
- Question: <b>Is all this even worth it?</b>
    - Yes. A common jiu-jitsu trick is to learn the ropes at a big company then jump into a bigger title at a smaller company.
