# Insights for interviews from Kahneman's Noise

### Types of noise
There are three types of noise:
- <b>Systematic noise</b> caused by consistent biases in judgement. Like an engineer who always under-estimates Jira stories.
- <b>Interpersonal noise</b> happens when different experts review the same data and come to different conclusions. Like when engineers disagree on a story estimate.
- <b>Situation noise</b> describes how the same expert changes their judgement based on random situational factor. Like an engineer who under-estimates when they're excited and over-estimates when tired.


### Bias cascades
- An important lesson from Noise focuses on bias cascades where different reviewers influence each other.
- If each person writes their estimate on the application for all to see, whomever writes the first eval determines the candidate's fate because other evaluators see the score and think that sounds about right instead of creating their own score.

### Insight for interviews
- Old style chat interviews are where you talk to a candidate and have a conversation <i>feel</i> the most effective. People love them because they get strong gut feel for the candidate and think that's good. &rarr; This type of interviews have 50% correlation with on-the-job performance because the decision has more to do with the interviewer thatn the interviewee.
- <i>Structured interviews</i> work better because questions are prepared in advance with defined evaluation rubric. Every candidate is asked the same questions in the same order. Then evaluate their answers against the rubric, not against how you feel &rarr; This can get you about 65% correlation with on-the-job performance.
