# Your background won't get you the job

Question: <i>Some people are worried that going to the wrong schools will close the door for BigTech jobs</i>
&rarr; It doesn't matter.

- Focus on the education you get, not the name
- If you're way past college, focus on the experience
- You resume can get you the interview. But it cannot get you the job. <i>You</i> have to that part <i>at the interview</i>

### What a resume can do for you
- Your resume - school, employers, side-projects - can get you the interview
- A top-tier name-brand schhol, name-brand employer can make the candidate stand out. However, something like <i>a history of writing in public, giving talks, or contributing to opensource</i> can also help the candidate stand out

### What a resume cannot do for you
- Even the best resume cannot get you a job
&rarr; The industry tries to hire on <i>can you do the job</i> not on <i>who you are as a person</i>

### The network effect
- The people you meet bias towards people who aim to do big things &rarr; You'll get opportunities you otherwise wouldn't even know about and you should learn how to leverage those opportunities through osmosis.
- Same is true for having worked at "the right" companies &rarr; You get a network, which opens doors, and you also learn what to look for, how to talk, what's a good opportunity, how to use it.
&rarr; Even that network can't do more than get you the interview, but with referral, you may skip the resume pile.

### The hidden curriculum effect
- Working at the right company means you gain experience that simply isn't available elsewhere

&rarr; You background can get you the interview, but not the job. <b>But the experience you've gained can make that interview a piece of cake</b>
