# What does "solve problems" even mean?

- We talk about how the goal of software engineering is to solve problems, not to write code. But what does that even mean? &rarr; It's a subtle change in perspective.
- Swizec then gave two examples to explain the idea above:
    - Teaching girlfriend's dad how to AI: Using chatGPT to solve Python problem in few minutes instead of a week. What Swizec did was:
        - Get on the phone and understand the problem.
        - Know that the girlfriend's dad cannot learn Python to finish this task in 1 week &rarr; Use ChatGPT-4 to solve it instead.
        - By talking through this process on a screen share:
            - Girlfriend's dad learned how to do it
            - Understood the thinking behind what Swizec's doing
            - Asked plenty of clarifying questions
            - Had a rough recipe to follow
        &rarr; Through this example, we can see that Swizec solved this problem by ultilizing AI to help non-programmer like the girlfriend's dad solve problem quickly. Swizec also made sure the dad know what he's doing and by him asking a lot of questions and follow the recipe, they could solve the problem faster than expected.
    - Unblocking 5 teams with 1 meeting: 
        - There's problem of migration feature flags to the new vendor but the platform team and the product team couldn't work together to make it work &rarr; Had a meeting with PMs and this process would take 4 months, whic was a lot of time
        - After 2 weeks, Swizec called a meeting with the platform teams and the lead architect &rarr; There's a BAA now (which they didn't have earlier) with the new vendor but the wraper making the migration harder &rarr; Moved the ownership to product teams and let they use new vendor to migrate when using their own product backlog &rarr; Clean up a bunch of old experiments.

&rarr; Don't be afraid to throw away work that isn't serving you anymore. <b>Focusing on solving problem, not doing the work</b>
