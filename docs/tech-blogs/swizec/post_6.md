# How to go from Senior to Lead


## 1. Work with your manager
- Step 1 is always tell your manager you want a promotion. From that, you can know what they expect to see from a lead engineer.
- The best managers will lay out a growth plan for you and step into a coaching role.
- Start using a portion of your regular 1-on-1 meetings as coaching sessions on your growth plan.
- Ask for feedback and share what you've tried.
- Your manager is in the best position to give you specific actionable advice. They see how you work, notice friction points with the team, and can feed you anonymous backchannel observation from the borader comnpany.

## 2. What is a lead engineer?
- Engineers can be identified at different levels: teachable, independent, tactical, and strategic
- You want junior engineers to be teachable and mid-level engineers to complete tasks independently. Senior engineers can own bigger stories, which includes project managing the story.
- Lead engineers think strategically. They help design the roadmap and can own a project that takes many months and multiple stories to build. A lot of work is helping product managers define intermdeiate steps towards a vision.
- A lead engineer can own projects that span multiple teams.

## 3. Lead engineer things you can do without the title
Here are a few things you can do without the Lead Engineer title that will help you think strategically and start making contributions at that level:
- Go to all sprint demo. Especially teams that your work touches
- Set up 1-on-1s with other teams. This builds informal comms networks that are the true way things get done
- Set up 1-on-1s with your product manager. Give technical feedback and ideas on projects long before they reach the team
- Notice friction points in the code and go fix them
- Ask about the business outcomes of your work
- Suggest ideas that drive business results
- Push back on ideas that don't drive business outcomes
- Ask to be included in strategic meetings and actively participate
- Ask about company plans and goals for the next 3 months, 6 months, 1 year
- Use that knowledge to prioritize your own work
- Funnel long-term strategy into your technical decisions. Refactoring a service that's dormant may not be worth the work, but if the team is about to invest heavy time into this area, you may be on to something
- Bushwhack for your team - venture ahead of the work and come back with a map
- Run around making small quality of life improvements, 5 minutes of work can have huge compounding returns
- Write SOPs - standard operating procedures
- Help. When a coworker gets stuck, be the first to jump
- Build relationships with stakeholders. Ask how your software helps their work. Ask what bugs them. Bring this back to y our product person
- Look for process friction and suggest improvements
- Makes sure your manager notices this work
- Brag for your team. When the team does something cool, tell others
- Notice other people's achievements. If someone did something you liked, tell them. Even if not on your tea
- Distill technical meetings into clear action plans. When people have completing ideas, push for clarity
