# How positioning makes you stand out from the crowd

Qeustion: <i>How's it possible that you can have both managers and Staff engineers. Don't their roles overlap? Are managers just shirking responsibilities?</i>

To Swizec:
- He and his manager are at the same level. They work as peers
- Managers handle the people stuff of the team. Staff engineers handle the technical stuff of the team.
- Managers help with routing people, HR, management questions. Staff engineers help with routing technical questions.
- The managers spends more time thinking about and navigating politics-like issues in the org than Staff engineers, which means Staff engineers can lean on their manager's expertise when org stuff is needed.
- <i>Org stuff</i> can be undestood as different teams have different cultures which cause problems, or there's misalignment between VPs and you don't know whose direction to follow.
&rarr; Point is <i><b>We focus on different things. It's not about who reports to whom</b></i>
