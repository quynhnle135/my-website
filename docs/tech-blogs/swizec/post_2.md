# Keep a high engineering culture, tips from the field

There's an old saying in startup circles:
> First-time founders focus on product. Second-time founders focus on distribution. Experienced founders focus on culture.

- Because culture builds products, guides engineering qualitym and determines long-term outcomes &rarr; It takes culture to survive long-term
- <i> How do you keep a high quality engineering culture?</i> &rarr; It's a lot of gardening and thankless work. You nudge in the right directions, lead by example, and hope for the best.

- The first theme was people saying that <b>you need to define what high quality engineering means to you</b> &rarr; This depends on what you're building.
- The next common theme was that <b>culture flows from leadership</b> &rarr; Leaderships, incentives (something that encourages a person to do something), and the culture they create always win at the end.
- The final big theme was to <b>focus on hiring</b> &rarr; Good engineers want to do good work.

- Approve with feedback: gives engineers the choice whether they want to implement what you suggest

- Pull request templates: nudge everyone to double-check their code's ready
- Put code quality on the product roadmap
- Let juniors speak first: build a culture of sharing ideas
- Apprenticeship: pair newbies with experienced pros and watch them learn

Another summary: <i> How do you maintain a high quality engineering culture without relying on a few caring individuals burning out?</i>
- Set high standards for everything, especially for hiring
