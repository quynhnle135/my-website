# Effective standups

- Here's what an effective standup looks like:
    - Work together as a team
    - Look at burndown chart to see if we're on track
    - Hide the Done column
    - Talk about where we're at
    - Agree on what we want to accomplish today
&rarr; Take a bout 5 min for a team of 5 people.

- <b>Work as a team</b>: 
    - Working on one story at a time together &rarr; Reduce work in progress and improve flow.
    - Making pull requests faster to review and helping each other easier to do &rarr; We're all thinking about the same things at standup
    &rarr; Not working together is where terrible standups come from
- <b>Look at burndown chart</b>:
    - To know if we're on track to finish standup or do we need to raise alarms
    - The earlier we can tell PM that something's wrong, the earlier we can re-align and re-negotiate our commitments
- <b>Hide the Done column</b>: The work is done, no need to discuss.
- <b>Talk about where we're at</b>:
    - Everyone talks about what they're working on, whether they need help, and what they plan to take on next.
    - Good time to raise any alarm or blocker you have: hidden dependency, missing requirements, or UX questions.
- <b> Aggree on what we want to accomplish today</b>:
    - At the end of standup we ask <i>"Does everyone know what we're trying to accomplish today?"</i> and define a clear objective.
    - This helps us stay focused and say No to things that show up but aren't important to what we want to get done today.
