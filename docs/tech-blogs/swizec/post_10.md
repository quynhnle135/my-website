# Life is Poker

- Life is not chess, it's poker &rarr; Gently putting your thumb on the scales is the best way we can do.
- Certainty is an illusion only probabilities are real. So what you do isn't <i>making plan the next 10 years</i>, it's <i>make good outcome a little more likely than bad outcome</i>
- You can apply this by <b>having a career vision</b> that helps you walk in direction and lets you own your career &rarr; You can also apply this to your day-to-day work to make decision faster
- Think about the hiring and interviewing probabilistically instead of feeling like you have no control, but also not beat yourself up, if things don't work everytime.
- You could even use an expected value approach to deciding whether to work for startups or bigtech.
- Don't forget about your <b>luck surface area</b> - that really matters.

## You career needs a vision
- A vision is like a goal or destination for your walk. No matter how fast you walk, how often you changes your jobs, you'll never make it farther without a vision.
- You can't choose your starting spot. That happened before you were born. <b>The rest is in your control.</b>
- How many steps do you take? How big are they? &rarr; That decides how fast you go and how many at-bats you get. <b>The more attempts, the better</b>
&rarr; <b><i>If you add a pinch of vision, a small bias towards your goal, you'll have a greate career</i></b>

## Startup vs BigTech vs Start Your Own

### BigTech
- BigTech is job that you won't either love it or hate it.
- Your experience will depend on your boss. Get a great boss, have a great job. Get a bad boss, hate your life.
- Your big salaries exists to keep you there. BigTech knows you're there for the money &rarr; This is a business relationship afterall.
- They pay you big big while you're useful. Stop being useful, they drop you like a hot potato
- Some of the complaints you may hear from people working at BigTech: this is boring, everything takes so long to get done, so many meetings, too much politics, etc &rarr; A lot of those come down to bad managers
- Your wealth and savings depend on which companies' stock you've got, how much you've sold, and how good you've been at avoiding lifestyle inflation.
- After 6 years you have: $329k/year compensation

### Startup
- Startups are a job but not quite because it depends on the size of startup you're in
- Small startups just starting out, you'll have a lot of fun building cool things with friends &rarr; You have control of what happens, huge impact on company trajectory
- Bigger startup morph into BigTech &rarr; The bigger the company, the less direct impact you have, the more layers of management, and the less fun you're having
- Your compensation is low compared to BigTech but you get a lottery ticket. This stock of yours, it's going to make it all worth it in the end.
- In return, you have to trust and believe. Because this startup is not just a job, it's your baby &rarr; You may work long nights, early mornings, long weekends, focus hard all day, and put in some muscle.
- The ownership you take during working in startups is huge and you should work hard, <b>super hard</b>
- Some of the complaints you may hear from people working at Startups: burnout, stress, changing company direction frequently, no idea if what you build today is still useful tomorrow, etc.
- After 6 years, you could be a millionaire or you could be back to work for normal companies.

### Start your own
- Start your own is the most stressful option &rarr; You're left with all of the control, all of the stress, and none of the compensation/
- Hire people and you are responsible for their livelihoods.
- It sucks but why would anyone do it? Because it's the only way to bring your dream to fruition &rarr; You get to be captain of your own ship.
- Six years from now on, maybe you're rich, maybe you're doing okay, maybe you're a beggar on the streets. &rarr; What's the worst can happen? You fail and get a $300k/year job at BigTech from your experience and the network you've built.

## Your luck & opportunity surface area
> Do you spend your time marketing yourself to others and letting people know your accomplishments, or do you spend the time doing work that will benefit others?

- If you do amazing work and nobody knows about it, your luck is zero
- If you do terrible work and everyone knows about it, your lick is zero
&rarr; Try your best to do amazing work and let people know about it. The more quality you put in your work and the more people know about your accomplishment, the larger your luck and opportunity your surface will expland
