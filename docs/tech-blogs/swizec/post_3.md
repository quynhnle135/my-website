## Software Engineers, Exercises, Health, and Productivity

How exercises, diet, and sleep affects your coding career?

- Modern consensus <i>(general agreement among)</i> seems to be: This stuff is super individualized &rarr; Try a bunch of things and see what works for you. <b>Observe yourself and adjust.</b>
- You don't need all the things people are selling or advertising &rarr; Eat a balanced diet instead, which have vegetables, carb, and protein at every meal. If you're getting cramps, add electrolytes. If you're feeling brainfog, you may be thirsty.
- Sleep <b>does</b> make you more productive. Your brain works better on enough sleep.
- Exercise <b>does</b> help you also. Exercise has been shown to have effects similar to medication for ADHD and depression.
- Good nutrition may help you, which has a big impact on your athletic performance and physique.

## Why Write?

- The <b>no strategy</b> strategy: Author's favorite approach to content strategies is a quote from Philip Morgan <i>I write every day because I think every day</i>
- A super power for structured thought:
    - Regular writing is a hidden super power that a lot of people miss out on &rarr; Publishing is even better because you also get feedback
    - Structured thougth is a huge career and success multiplier when you're a few years into your career and the earlier you start developing that muscle, the better
- The premature expert trap:   
    - This is a trap almost everyone falls into when they start writing is <b>writing like an expert when you are not yet an expert</b> &rarr; Just write what you know.
    - The critical shift you see in people from going from junior to senior is that they stop speaking from principles and start speaking from experience &rarr; <b>Share insights you've gained from doing stuff</b>, use research to support those insights
    - Summararizing your research is valuable, but mostly for you. <b>Summarizing your experience is valuable for everyone</b>.
