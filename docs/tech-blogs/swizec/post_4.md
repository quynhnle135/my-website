# Don't Neglect Your Upgrades & Work With Product

## Don't Neglect Your Upgrades

- The promise of software is that you build it once and then the code keeps doing your jobs &rarr; That's why engineers are paid so much. 
- But software automation has a flaw - once built, you keep fiddling with it &rarr; There's always something you could make a little bit better.
- Stop fiddling! The solution is to build your code and leave it alone so you won't introduce new bugs, you won't waste time poking around, and you won't have to learn new ways of doing things &rarr; This can be applied to your small projects becasue software is always changed or you just counld't expect what might happen along the way &rarr; The <b><i>leave it</i></b> strategy is greate for side projects only.
- While you're standing still, everyone else is running &rarr; The longer you leave your code unchanged, the more it falls behind.
- For examples: Coding standards become stale and misunderstood. Quirky workarounds get official library solutions. 3rd party APIs change, etc.
&rarr; <b>Small upgrades are easier to manage. Upgrade early and often or pay the big price later.</b>

## Work With Product
- A strong partnership with product is key to an enjoyable engineering life:
    - Strong partnership feels like <i>"I deeply understand why we're building the thing, have strong input on the roadmap, and work on what feels most important"</i>
- <b>Accountability</b>:
    - On a team that has this strong partnership, product is accountable for why and what, engineering is accountable for when and how
    - <b>You co-own the why as a team</b>, those are your objectives. Product is accountable for making sure your objectives make sense and keep track of the progress.
    - <b>You collaborate on the what</b>, those are your Key Results &rarr; You have to keep them honest, make sure the "what" is buildbale within the budget, and help message ideas into a version you can build.
    - <b>You collaborate on the when</b>, that's your roadmap &rarr; Engineering is accountable for estimates and execution. 
    - <b>You own the how</b>, that's your implementation details &rarr; You're close to the code and know what it needs. You'll maintain what you build so whatever works for you goes.
- <b>What this looks like in practice?</b>
    - <b>You talk constantly</b> as you dig in and get your hands dirty.
    - You discuss and debate and negotiate a balance between idea and reality.
    - Then you write the stories together. A record of your agreement so you don't forget &rarr; The stories may change during implementation and you have to adjust your job
    - You build the roadmap together and you can even break down or join stories while building &rarr; You own the when and how.
