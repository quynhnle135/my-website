# What I Learned from Team Topologies

- Conway's law: 
    - Conway's law says that the structure of your software will naturally follow the structure of your org.
    - > Any organization that designs a system (defined broadly) will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization's communication structure
- Scaling teams is a technical problem:
    - There are two types of "scale" in software: Performance scale and Team scale.
    - <b>Scaling for performance</b> means building software that can handle more load. More requests, heavier requests, faster responses, etc.
    - <b>Scaling for teams</b> means building software that more people can work on. How do we work without stepping on each other's toes, avoid too many cooks in the kitchen, ensure consistency, avoid bugs when the left hand doesn't know what the right is doing, etc.
    - <b>Because your software is eventually going to refect your team structure</b>, that means team design is a technical problem. You are designing your software by designing your teams.
- Reverse Conway manuever:
    - Team Topologies takes this "team design is a technical problem" approach even further and suggests using aggressively
    - If you find yourself in a confusing situation with another team where you suddenly have weirdly shared ownership of a domain you barely understand, boundaries will appear and you'll find the way to conmprehend and solve the problem.
- Two types of teams:
    - Vertical teams: Can deliver user value end-to-end
    - Horizontal teams: Build platforms for vertical teams to use
    - For a team to be truly independent, it needs to own the full stack of its domains. Build features from idea to deploy without having to wait on others.
