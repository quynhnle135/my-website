# Dealing with Imposter Syndrome

> Imposter syndrome is characterized by a persistent belief that your work accomplishments and success aren’t deserved, and a feeling that you’re about to be revealed as a phony at any moment.

## What is imposter syndrome? 

- Imposter syndrome has nothing to do with your lack of raw tech skills. 
- It often occurs when you are around other people who seem more confident than yourself, you are in a new situation you've never tackled, or you are onboarding into a new job or position.
- Examples when the author experienced imposter syndrome: 
    * Learned a new language or framework
    * Started a new job with new system or people
    * Landed a new position with added responsibilities
    * Met people who were different than me and challenged my ideas
&rarr; Instead of trying to stuff our imposter syndrome feelings, we need to acknowledge them and recognize them for what they are really are

## What if my imposter syndrome is true? I'm not good at what I need to be good at
- You may put a lot of work and don't see much progress. Eventually, mistakes and wins start to add up and you rocket up exponentially to a new level.
&rarr; If it's truly a lack of technical skills causing you imposter syndrome, focus on that. Consistently focus on learning.

## 10 practical ways to deal with imposter syndrome
- Get comfortable saying "I don't know": Learning is an endless frontier. Embrace the journey
- Keep working on any areas you struggle in:
    * Write down skills you are weaker in and work hard to level up in those areas.
    * Consistent and steady learning really add up.
- Record your wins and successes: Keep a brag doc of everything you've learned and accomplished and refresh and review it regularly
- Regconize that failures add up and lead to success: Embrace failure as part of the learning process &rarr; You will succeed as you keep at it consistently
- See yourself through other peoples eyes: They hired you because they believe in you and see your ability to contribute huge value &rarr; Don't undersell yourself
- Practice being confident in what you do know
- Remember what we all struggle with this
- Be patient, confidence develops with time
- Embrace imposter syndrome as a reminder of growth: Remind yourself that imposter syndrome often creeps up when you are growing and trying something new.
- Practice self care and compassion: Encourage yourself and be patient with yourself just like you'd do with someone you were mentoring.
