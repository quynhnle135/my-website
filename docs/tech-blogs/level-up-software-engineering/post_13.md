# 8 common interviewing mistakes

## 1. Asking very general questions
- Interviewing is a two way street. You should be interviewing them and figuring out if they are a good fit for you, just as much as the other way around
- Asking really thoughtful and informed questions is a great way to do that
- You can learn about their products, their culture, why they are hiring for that role, what success in the position would look like, etc
- Asking good questions will really show your interest in the company, and help you stand out

## 2. Forgetting your fundamentals
- Interviewee shouldn't be rusty on some of their core web skills or fundamentals

## 3. Not using clean coding or design patterns
- I wonder if we hear things like SOLID, GoF, Clean Code, etc, and nod along that it's a good idea, but then we forget to apply it to basic things like API design and backend code organization
- There are some really simple things that you can do to help your code be more readable, maintainable, and extensible
- Put your business logic in a "service layer" like classes, methods, or functions and unit test them.
- Here are a few other things that go a long way:
    * Break apart massive functions
    * Make sure functions only do one thing
    * Use an early return, rather than nested ifs
    * Use well named variables instead of magic numbers or comments
- Brush up on your design patterns, and know when, where, and why to use them

## 4. Not able to switch between big pictures and details
- In real world and in interviewing, we need to think both about both big pictures and details
- We should be able to talk about systems from a high level architecture perspective - load balancers, caching, db performance, service to serivce communication, etc. But also dive deep into something when needed
- Knowing where performance bottlenecks in your system will arise based on different load types, and being able to suggest good solutions in details is huge
- Being able to zoom in and zoom out from the big picture to small details without losing focus or getting lost in the weeds will really help you stand out

## 5. Reading your resume as an intro
- Your introduction should be short (90 seconds), interesting, and grab the attention of the interviewer
- The worst thing you can do is not having an intro. The second worst is just reading off your resume
- Here's an idea on what you should cover during your intro:
    * Share that you are excited about the company
    * Give a quick summary of your last 2-3 years and a project or two you  worked on
    * Share an interesting tidbit of how you think that would help you be a great fit for the new company

## 6. Getting married to your solution
- Be flexible. If an interviewer says your approach or solution isn't quite working, don't keep beating a dead horse. 
- Learn how to pivot and try something new. It will really help your chances, and show your strength as a problem solver

## 7. Spraying and praying resumes
- You need to do something to stand out because every job might have 100s to 1000s of other engineers applying for the same job
- Here's something I've seen work really well:
    * Select yout top 10-20 companies
    * Research them deeply
    * Connecting with a hiring manager or other engineers there
    * Learning everything you can about their products, market, who they serve, what they value, their culture, etc
    * Put that research into your cover letter and weave it in throughout interviewing
    * Treat the interviewing rounds like building a relationship
    * Show them how you can help solve their problems and contribute towards their goals. Don't just talk about yourself. Talk about them and how you can help them

## 8. Not quantifying your wins
- Prepare brag docs:
    * Every day keep a little log of your daily wins and learnings
    * Every other week summarize these into bigger wins
    * Look to quantify them wherever possible - you may need to talk with business and product leaders to get some actual numbers
    * Every couple months, summarize those wins again until it's just your best ones
    * Use these wins and learnings in your resume, performance reviews, interviews, etc
