# Supercharge your career growth

Here are 15 traits that top performing engineers have

## 1. Develop a bias for action
- Having a bias fo action means if you're asking <i>"should I do something about this?"</i>, the answer is <b>YES</b>

## 2. Be flexible
- Never say <i>"That's not my job"</i>
- There are many times in your career where you'll need to <b>wear many hats</b>
&rarr; Being willing to jump in, learn, and help wherever needed, you can develop better understanding of projects end-to-end and help you become a more valuable contributor

## 3. Be trustworthy and reliable
- Build your team's trust by doing what you'll do
- Do your best, but if you cannot accomplish something on time &rarr; say something, raise a blocker, and come with creative ideas on how to still complete the goal

## 4. Own your growth
- Be proactive in pursuing your own growth path and development as a leader

## 5. Advocate for change, and lead the charge
- Don't wait for someone else to tell you what to do &rarr; Advocate for changes you want to see happen, then lead the charge
- Make sure the charge is inclusive and actually helps everyone 

## 6. Don't overcomplicate processes
- Keep processes minimal until you need them. 
- Don't add something just because everyone is doing it &rarr; Only add something if there's a clear value add to doing so

## 7. Use standard and proven technologies
- A few wins of using standard technology include:
    * a wider market for hiring
    * simple onboarding to your systems
    * able to take advantage of 3rd party solutions maturing
&rarr; Focus on writing custom code for your unique value proposition - use standard libraries and solutions for everything else

## 8. Work to remove SPOFs
- A single point of failure (SPOF) is a part of a system that if it fails, it will stop the entire system from working
- Find insider-knowledge that is “invisible”, and remove the risk by:
    * Documentation
    * Pair-programming
    * Internal tech talks
    * Alternating product areas
- When de-SPOFing, it's helpful to do a system design audit to determine what pieces of your stack have zero redundancy, which could include databases, authorization library, user logins or session, core microservices, etc

## 9. Be a force multiplier for the team
- Be a force multiplier for the team is all about expanding your vision and scope of influence &rarr; It's about helping other engineers on your team level up
- Here are a few common ways you can be a force multiplier:
    * Help unblock other engineers (pairing, brainstorming, walkthroughs, technical spec collaboration, one-on-one’s)
    * Helpful, through, and timely code reviews
    * Mentor up and coming engineers in areas they struggle
    * Develop diagrams & documentation for complex systems or code areas

## 10. Grow your communication skills:
- As a software engineer, you have to communicate regulary, for examples:
    * giving feedback during code review
    * writing code that is clear, concise, and disocverable
    * developing technical documentation and diagrams for new projects
&rarr; The more senior you want to become, the more important it is to have excellent technical communication skills

## 11. Develop your product and business sense
- Your job as an engineer is not just clean, fast, and elegant code, but <b>building software for humans</b>
- Investing time to learn why we buid what we build, how it help our customers, how it will grow our business
- You can try to understand things like:
    * What the priorities should be on large, complex projects
    * Areas of tech debt that need immediate attention
    * Ways to bring a new idea to market with very little engineering effort
    * How to speak with clients and business people in a way they understand

## 12. Learn the art of managing up
- Managing up is learning to view your work throught leadership eyes &rarr; <b>It's about the big picture</b>
- In regards to projects and time management:
    * Where are your projects at? Have you given clear, concise updates?
    * Are you blocked on anything and how could you get around the blockers?
    * What are the hidden things eating up y our time?
- In regards to being a force-multiplier:
    * What ares do you need to grow in, and how can you pursue that?
    * Are you mentoring other engineers, and thus helping the team level up?
    * Are you influencing the team for the visions your manager has laid out?
- In regards to productivity:
    * Are there any high priority tasks and bugs that only you know about?
    * Is there anything you could train others on to de-SPOF yourself?
    * Are you updating Linear/Jira tickets with estimates and status updates?

## 13. Mentor and be mentored
- Mentors can help you see talents and skills you might think are “normal”, when in reality they are rare and valuable! They can also help you grow by identifying areas you are weaker in
- You can also give back to the community by offering the mentorship to new hires or juniors

## 14. Prioritize your work ruthlessly
- Because there may be a lot on your plate, you have to learn how to ruthlessly prioritize your work 

## 15. Hire the right people to join your team
- Here are some things I look for in new hires:
    * Someone who will help your team level up technically
    * Someone who will bring fresh and diverse ideas
    * Someone who fits the values of the organization
    * Someone who’s passionate about making a difference
