# 5 ways to gain your team's trust

## 1. Deliver value consistently
- Keep showing up and be consistent delivery of value to the teams and companies you work with
- Consistently showing up again and again really adds up:   
    * It's how you earn the trust of your leadership
    * It's how you start getting handed challenging projects
    * It's how you grow and learn interesting new things

## 2. Honor your commitments
- If people can count on you to honor your commiments - to do what you said you will do - you'll go far &rarr; Means that you keep what you promise
- If you are flaky, inconsistent, and don't keep people informed on your progress, it will be hard for leaders to trust you
&rarr; <b>Honor your commitments and you will become very trusted, and quickly grow the ranks wherever you work</b>

## 3. Speak up when something is off 
- Do your best, to hit estimates and goals - but if you can't accomplish something on time &rarr; Say something. Speak up early!
- Don't silently suffer trying to hit an unrealistic deadline you set months ago &rarr; Raise a flag and ask for some help
- There are many levers a good engineering manager and business can use to help get the project on track:
    * Cutting project scope
    * Pushing out the launch deadline
    * Adding more engineers to the project
    * Projecting you and the team from intertuptions

## 4. Provide creative solutions
- Anytime you raise a blocker, come with a few creative ideas on how we might be able to meet the original business goals. For examples:
    * Having someone manually do work instead of coding it up
    * Rolling out an MVP, and adding lower priority features later on
    * Starting with a simpler system, and scaling up if needed when traffic grows

## 5. Give accurate updates
- Good leaders care more about reliable, accurate update - knowing where the project actually is at - than you working overtime to meet unrealistic deadlines
- Therefore, when you give estimates for projects be sure to include all the work to really do your best work:
    * Writing tests
    * writing a technical spec
    * Adding API documentation
    * Working through the small bus that always come up
&rarr; The worst thing you can do is underestimate your work. Do your best to break down a complex project into small understandable chunks, and estimate them reasonably to the best of your ability.
