# What's the difference between junior, mid-level, senior, and staff engineers?

These positions have nothing to do with how many lines of code you wrote. It's also not tied to years of experiences. It's more to do with <b>mindset, responsibility, technical expertise and communication, how you approach problems, leadership skills, and scope of your influence</b>

## Junior engineer
- Junior engineer have 0-3 years of development experience, who are fresh out of college, newly self-taught, or coming from a bootcamp
- They should be proficient in one or two languages and frameworks, be able to build small to medium-sized features with directions
- <b>At this level, engineers mostly focus on leveling up in their coding capabilities and get up to speed with engineering best practices</b>
- They might do things like:
    * Improve an existing codebase by adding missing tests to legacy code
    * Migrate an old feature to a new framework or components
    * Adding to existing APIs
    * Working with senior engineers on pieces of larger projects
- <b>Junior engineers will require mentorship</b> from oter seniors on the team to ensure they are successful, and continue to level up

## Mid-level engineer
- Mid-level engineers usually have 3-5 years of experiences
- They should be proficient in 2-3 languages and frameworks, and be able to build new feature with minimal direction needed from other engineers
- At this level, engineers focus mostly on increasing their depth of knowledge in languages, framework, and coding patterns as well as starting to contribute and own pieces of larger projects
- They might do things like:
    * Build out a new set of apis, services, and db tables for a new feature
    * Contribute quality components to the team’s style guide
    * Refactor and optimize old queries, legacy code, or fix complex bugs
&rarr; Mid-level enginners will be able to tackle many more things on their own, and provide support to juniors

## Senior engineer
- Senior engineers:
    * Have 5+ years of experiences
    * Have depth of knowledge and proficiency on serveral larger projects
    * Have mastred several languages and able to learn new technology or framework if needed
    * Have deep problem-solving skills and cross-language engineering knowledge and experience
    * Stand out in communication, project management, system design, architecture experience, documentation initiatives, and offer mentorship to help the team level up
- They should be able to:
    * Plan, research, breakdown, and successfully complete a large project
    * Identify and fix issues in complex systems
    * Lead a project with multiple contributors including writing technical specs, helping with sprint prioritization and planning, outlining a testing plan, etc.
    * Give through, helpful, and timely code reviews
    * Provide mentoring, technical interviews, onboarding, documentation - things that help the team level up
    * Successfully juggle multiple priorities or projects
    * Emerge as force multiplier for their product area

## Staff engineer
- As staff engineers, they have:
    * 8-15 years of experiences
    * Influence and be responsible for serveral team at startips
    * At a larger organization, they may be staffed to one larger team
    * They closely partner with engineering managers and co-own the success of engineering culture, technical solutions, and systems accorss the teams and many projects
    * Work on solutions dealing with large, very complex, and important technical and business systems
    * They set the standard for all other engineers in the organization
&rarr; Where they differ mainly from a senior engineer is influence and scope
- They should be able to:
    * Ship and model the highest quality of work
    * Influence the org’s culture around best practices in testing, rollouts, monitoring, scaling, etc.
    * Spot pain points or weakness in technical or organizational systems and propose and lead solutions
    * Lead complex projects with clear deliverables and milestones that may span multiple years
    * Leverage cross-functional leaders in design, product, security, data science, to work towards team goals/projects
    * Give strong technical / business communication both oral and written
