### 316. Remove Duplicate Letters

```python
def removeDuplicateLetters(s):
    result = ""
    last_occ = {}
    stack = []
    visited = set()
    for i in range(len(s)):
        last_occ[s[i]] = i

    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] not in visited:
            while stack and stack[-1] > s[i] and last_occ[stack[-1]] > i:
                visited.remove(stack.pop())
            visited.add(s[i])
            stack.append(s[i])
    for letter in stack:
        result += letter
    return result


def main():
    print(removeDuplicateLetters("bcabc"))
    print(removeDuplicateLetters("cbacdcbc"))


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

#### Notes:
- For this problem, the main thing that I need to pay attention to is the lexicographical order
- An example of lexicographical order is that "abcd" is smaller than "abef" (based on the length and alphebetical order)
- However, the problem requires to remove the duplicate letter in order, not remove the duplicate letters and rearrange to the smallest possible lexicographical order. That's why I need to use stack and queue to keep track and compare 


### 151. Reverese words in a string

```python
import re


def reverse_word(word, start, end):
    while start < end:
        temp = word[end]
        word[end] = word[start]
        word[start] = temp
        start += 1
        end -= 1


def reverse_words_in_a_string(sentence):
    sentence = re.sub(" +", " ", sentence.strip())
    sentence = list(sentence)
    reverse_word(sentence, 0, len(sentence) - 1)
    start = end = 0
    while start < len(sentence):
        while end < len(sentence) and sentence[end] != " ":
            end += 1
        reverse_word(sentence, start, end - 1)
        start = end = end + 1
    return "".join(sentence)


def reverse_words_in_a_string_ii(s):
    s = re.sub(" +", " ", s.strip())
    start = end = 0
    words = []
    word = ""
    while start < len(s):
        while end < len(s) and s[end] != " ":
            word += s[end]
            end += 1
        words.append(word)
        word = ""
        start = end = end + 1
    return " ".join(words[::-1])


def main():
    s = "the sky is blue"
    print(reverse_words_in_a_string(s), len(reverse_words_in_a_string(s)))
    print(reverse_words_in_a_string_ii(s), len(reverse_words_in_a_string_ii(s)))


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

#### Notes:
- Go over the second approach which is a little bit similar to the first one but I don't need to implement another helper function
- re.sub(" +", " ", s.strip()) is a key point here to make the solution shorter and more effective.

### 114. Flatten Binary Tree to Linked List

``` python 
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def flatten_binary_tree(root):
    current = root
    while current:
        if current.left:
            last = current.left
            while last.right:
                last = last.right
            last.right = current.right
            current.right = current.left
            current.left = None
        current = current.right
    

```

#### Notes:
- I still comtemplate this problem since it's a little bit confusing.
- It requires to do everythin in-place so there's no need to return anything. How can I print out the result? Should I print it as a linked list or a Tree? 
- Basuically, does this exercise requrie to move every node in the left branch to right branch but is there any order that it's looking for? 


### 222. Count complete tree nodes

```python 
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right


def count_complete_nodes(root):
    return inorder_traversal_count(root, 0)


def inorder_traversal_count(current, count):
    if current:
        count += 1
        count = inorder_traversal_count(current.left, count)
        count = inorder_traversal_count(current.right, count)
    return count


def main():
    root = TreeNode(3)
    root.left = TreeNode(9)
    root.left.left = TreeNode(20)
    root.left.left.left = TreeNode(15)
    root.left.left.left.left = TreeNode(7)
    print(count_complete_nodes(root))


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

#### Notes:
- I applied Inorder Traversal since it's count the current node first then move on to its left and right children


### 111. Minimum depth of binary tree

```python 
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right


def minDepth(root):
    if not root:
        return 0
    if not root.left:
        return 1 + minDepth(root.right)
    if not root.right:
        return 1 + minDepth(root.left)
    return 1 + min(minDepth(root.left), minDepth(root.right))


def main():
    root = TreeNode(3)
    root.left = TreeNode(9)
    root.left.left = TreeNode(20)
    root.left.left.left = TreeNode(15)
    root.left.left.left.left = TreeNode(7)
    print(minDepth(root))


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

#### Notes:
- When I first tried to solve this problem, I forgot to consider if the left branch or the right branch is None. Therefore, if it falls to that case, my function always return 1 because of the root is counted as 1 and it's the minimum 
- I tried to improve and set the edge case for empty left branch or right branch


### 404. Sum of left leaves

```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right


def sumOfLeftLeaves(root):
    return helper(root, False)


def helper(current, isLeft):
    if not current:
        return 0
    if not current.left and not current.right and isLeft:
        return current.val
    return helper(current.left, True) + helper(current.right, False)


def main():
    root = TreeNode(3)
    root.left = TreeNode(9)
    root.right = TreeNode(20)
    root.right.left = TreeNode(15)
    root.right.right = TreeNode(7)
    print(sumOfLeftLeaves(root))


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

#### Notes:
- The main key for the solution is to check if it's the left node or not
