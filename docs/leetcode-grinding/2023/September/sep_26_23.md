### 316. Remove Duplicate Letters

```python
def removeDuplicateLetters(s):
    result = ""
    last_occ = {}
    stack = []
    visited = set()
    for i in range(len(s)):
        last_occ[s[i]] = i

    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] not in visited:
            while stack and stack[-1] > s[i] and last_occ[stack[-1]] > i:
                visited.remove(stack.pop())
            visited.add(s[i])
            stack.append(s[i])
    for letter in stack:
        result += letter
    return result


def main():
    print(removeDuplicateLetters("bcabc"))
    print(removeDuplicateLetters("cbacdcbc"))


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

#### Notes:
- For this problem, the main thing that I need to pay attention to is the lexicographical order
- An example of lexicographical order is that "abcd" is smaller than "abef" (based on the length and alphebetical order)
- However, the problem requires to remove the duplicate letter in order, not remove the duplicate letters and rearrange to the smallest possible lexicographical order. That's why I need to use stack and queue to keep track and compare
